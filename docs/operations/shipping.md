# Shipping

This document describes the current shipping model in The Pool, including its Worker-first pricing flow, fork-facing config surface, USPS integration boundary, and the rule tree the cart, checkout, Manage Pledge, reporting, and emails now follow.

Live USPS credentialed verification is now wired into the local workflow. The repo includes a dedicated USPS smoke helper plus automated regressions for the cart, checkout, and Manage Pledge shipping flows.

## Recommended Scope

Current implemented scope:

- USPS live rating for **US domestic**
- USPS live rating for **international**
- a configurable **flat fallback shipping rate** when USPS is unavailable or returns no usable rate
- a limited backer-facing **delivery option** selector for `Standard`, `Signature required`, and `Adult signature required` where applicable
- explicit manual domestic flat-rate tables for qualifying items like `sticker` and `signed_script`
- campaign-tier and support-item shipping metadata
- a shared preset catalog for common physical items

For The Pool, the fallback rate is **$3.00**.

## Guardrails

### Security

The shipping calculator must comply with the current security model:

- shipping totals stay Worker-calculated and canonical
- the browser never becomes the source of truth for shipping math
- destination/shipment inputs are validated and normalized before quoting
- no insecure direct browser calls to USPS
- no long-lived client storage of sensitive shipping quote state beyond what the current checkout flow already needs
- USPS failures must degrade to the configured fallback rate rather than creating an unsafe bypass or a broken checkout state
- any new Worker responses that contain shipping quote internals should follow the current no-store / private response posture where appropriate

### Accessibility

The shipping feature must preserve the current accessibility baseline:

- shipping-related address, quote, and fallback states must be understandable with keyboard-only interaction
- any new errors or notices must be tied to the relevant fields and live regions appropriately
- shipping summary updates in checkout and Manage Pledge must remain screen-reader understandable
- no regressions to the existing dialog/focus/error semantics in checkout or `Update Card`
- browser-level accessibility coverage should be expanded if new shipping UI states are introduced

### Internationalization

The shipping feature must fit the current i18n model:

- site-owned shipping labels, fallback messaging, and summary text should come from locale catalogs
- Worker supporter emails should use localized shipping labels/breakdowns where they already include shipping totals
- no hardcoded English-only copy should be introduced in checkout, Manage Pledge, result pages, or emails
- the feature should work correctly on localized routes such as `/es/manage/` and localized checkout entry paths

## Why This Scope Fits

### USPS risk

USPS pricing APIs appear usable without obvious per-call billing for the basic pricing access, but they are quota-limited and can require manual quota-increase requests.

That means the main operational risk is:

- quota / throttling

not obviously:

- direct USPS per-request charges

### KV risk

The current checkout flow already uses Worker/KV for:

- checkout bundle manifests
- pledge persistence
- stats updates
- limited-tier reservations

Shipping should not add a large new KV footprint. The safe design is:

- quote shipping only at high-intent points
- avoid per-quote KV writes
- persist only the final shipping amount on the pledge

## High-Level Design

### 1. Worker-calculated shipping

Shipping must stay server-calculated, not browser-calculated.

That means:

- `/checkout-intent/start` calculates shipping from canonical item data plus destination
- `/pledge/modify` recalculates shipping only when shipping-relevant inputs change
- the final shipping amount is stored in the pledge record and included in all downstream math

### 2. Fallback behavior

If USPS is unavailable, times out, or returns no usable rate:

- use the configured fallback flat shipping rate

For The Pool:

- `shipping.fallback_flat_rate: 3.00`
- optional campaign-level `shipping_fallback_flat_rate` overrides for special cases

That keeps checkout resilient and avoids shipping becoming a hard blocker.

### 3. Service selection

Keep the option set intentionally narrow:

- `Standard`
  - default
  - chooses the cheapest eligible USPS service
- `Signature required`
  - optional
  - domestic only
  - only shown when the campaign enables it
- `Adult signature required`
  - optional
  - domestic only
  - only shown when the campaign explicitly enables it

Do not expose speed-based service choices in v1. Crowdfunding rewards often ship long after the pledge date, so delivery speed is not the meaningful customer choice here; delivery confirmation is.

The current cart and Manage Pledge UI therefore expose a narrow delivery-option selector rather than a full mail-class selector. The Worker still picks the underlying cheapest valid shipping class for `Standard`.

## Config Surface

Add a structured `shipping` section to [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml), for example:

```yml
shipping:
  origin_zip: "87120"
  origin_country: "US"
  fallback_flat_rate: 3.00
  default_option: standard
  quote_timeout_ms: 2500

      stack_height_in: 0.1

      usps_domestic:

        rate_indicator: SP
        mail_classes:
          - MEDIA_MAIL
          - USPS_GROUND_ADVANTAGE
          - PRIORITY_MAIL
```

That config should stay site-driven and auto-mirror any Worker-required values into [`worker/wrangler.toml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/wrangler.toml).

Optional preset-level shipping hints can live inside preset metadata too. The current implementation supports:

- `manual_domestic_rate`
- `usps_domestic.processing_category`
- `usps_domestic.rate_indicator`
- `usps_domestic.destination_entry_facility_type`
- `usps_domestic.price_type`
- `usps_domestic.mail_classes`

`manual_domestic_rate` is currently domestic-only and supports `FIRST_CLASS_FLAT`, using USPS Notice 123 retail First-Class Mail Large Envelope (Flat) pricing. It only applies when the whole shipment still qualifies for flat mail by weight and dimensions; otherwise the system falls through to the live USPS path.

The USPS-specific hints only apply when the whole physical shipment resolves to the same preset-style USPS profile; mixed shipments fall back to the default parcel quote model.

That means you can encode a conservative “cheapest valid class first” order per preset without trying to infer it on the fly from raw dimensions alone. The current site uses that pattern in two places:

- `sticker`
  - uses the manual `FIRST_CLASS_FLAT` domestic rate when the shipment still qualifies
  - otherwise falls through to a cheaper single-piece USPS parcel profile
- `signed_script`
  - uses the manual `FIRST_CLASS_FLAT` domestic rate when the shipment still qualifies
  - otherwise falls through to `MEDIA_MAIL`, then `USPS_GROUND_ADVANTAGE`, then `PRIORITY_MAIL`
- `cd`, `dvd`, and `bluray`
  - try `MEDIA_MAIL` first
  - then fall through to `USPS_GROUND_ADVANTAGE`
  - then `PRIORITY_MAIL`

We intentionally do not apply true “letter” or “flat” logic automatically. The current USPS Prices API path we use does not expose domestic First-Class letter/flat rating directly, so flat-mail pricing is handled as an explicit manual table, not a live USPS quote.

## Content Model Changes

### Tiers

Add optional shipping metadata to physical tiers:

```yml
tiers:
  - id: tshirt
    category: physical
    shipping_preset: tshirt
```

Or explicit overrides:

```yml
tiers:
  - id: deluxe-box
    category: physical
    shipping:
      weight_oz: 32
      packaging_weight_oz: 4
      length_in: 12
      width_in: 10
      height_in: 4
      stack_height_in: 1
```

### Support items

Allow the same shipping metadata on physical support items if we support physical add-ons there.

## Packing Strategy

Do not build full cartonization in v1.

Use a simpler heuristic:

- sum item weights across physical items and quantities
- add any one-time `packaging_weight_oz` allowance from the selected tier/support-item profiles
- use the largest selected `length_in` / `width_in`
- use `height_in + stack_height_in * (qty - 1)` for multi-quantity physical tiers
- pass the resulting parcel to USPS rating

This is approximate, but much more realistic than the current flat fee and far smaller than building a real packing engine.

## USPS Usage Strategy

### USPS Credentials How-To

For this platform, you do **not** need the Labels APIs to quote shipping. The Pool's current shipping implementation only needs:

- OAuth
- Domestic Pricing
- International Pricing
- Shipping Options

Those are part of the default USPS app product described in USPS's official getting-started flow.

As of April 14, 2026, the practical setup path is:

1. Create or sign into a USPS Business Account through the USPS Customer Onboarding Portal (COP).
2. In COP, open `My Apps` and create an app.
3. In that app's `Credentials` section, copy the:
   - `Consumer Key`
   - `Consumer Secret`
4. Use those as OAuth client credentials:
   - `Consumer Key` -> `client_id`
   - `Consumer Secret` -> `client_secret`

In this repo, that maps to:

- [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml)
  - `shipping.usps.client_id`
  - `shipping.usps.enabled`
  - optional `shipping.usps.api_base` if you need to point at TEM explicitly
  - optional USPS behavior knobs like `timeout_ms`, `quote_cache_ttl_seconds`, and cooldown settings
- Worker secrets / local Worker env
  - `USPS_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - optional `USPS_API_BASE`

Do **not** commit the USPS client secret into Jekyll config.

For a normal production-style local setup, the minimum values this repo needs are:

- [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml) or [`_config.local.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.local.yml)
  - `shipping.usps.enabled: true`
  - `shipping.usps.client_id: "<your Consumer Key>"`
- [`worker/.dev.vars`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/.dev.vars)
  - `USPS_CLIENT_SECRET=<your Consumer Secret>`

If you want to test against USPS TEM with the same production credentials USPS describes, also set:

- `shipping.usps.api_base: "https://apis-tem.usps.com"` in config
  or
- `USPS_API_BASE=https://apis-tem.usps.com` in Worker env

For local testing:

- set `shipping.usps.client_id` in [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml) or your local override path
- set `USPS_CLIENT_SECRET=...` in [`worker/.dev.vars`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/.dev.vars)
- run:

```bash
npm run sync:worker-config
./scripts/dev.sh --podman
```

For a quick live USPS credential and quote sanity check without booting the whole stack, run:

```bash
npm run test:usps
```

That helper exercises the real Worker shipping module against a small smoke matrix:

- domestic physical tier
- domestic signature-required option
- international physical tier
- campaign add-on only shipment
- platform add-on only shipment

USPS also says you can test with your production credentials against the Testing Environment for Mailers by switching the base URL from `apis.usps.com` to `apis-tem.usps.com`.

The default USPS app product currently includes the APIs this feature needs:

- OAuth
- Domestic Pricing
- International Pricing
- Shipping Options

If you need additional access or a quota increase, USPS directs developers to submit a service request through their `Email Us` support flow.

What you can safely ignore for this repo right now:

- Labels APIs
- Ship / EPA enrollment
- any return-label or postage-purchase setup

Those are only needed if this project grows from quoting into actual USPS label generation.

Practical operational note for this platform:

- USPS documents `429` as an exceeded hourly quota condition
- this shipping implementation therefore uses:
  - Worker-only USPS calls
  - short in-memory quote reuse
  - temporary cooldowns after `429`, timeout, or repeated USPS failures
  - flat fallback shipping when USPS is unavailable

That keeps the platform aligned with USPS's quota model without turning shipping quotes into a KV-heavy subsystem.

Only call USPS at high-intent moments:

- checkout start
- pledge modification when physical selections or destination changed

Do not call USPS:

- on public campaign page loads
- on every cart render
- on every quantity/tip keystroke in the browser

### Caching

Avoid KV-backed quote-history caching in v1.

If needed, use a short-lived in-memory / platform-cache style cache keyed by:

- origin ZIP
- origin country
- destination postal code
- destination country
- package weight
- package dimensions

The important rule is:

- do not turn shipping quotes into a high-write KV subsystem

The checkout country selector is now fed from [`_data/shipping_countries.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_data/shipping_countries.yml), which keeps USPS destination maintenance in a dedicated source instead of burying it in browser runtime code.

## Worker and Frontend Touchpoints

### Worker

Main logic seams already exist in:

- [worker/src/index.js](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/src/index.js)
- [worker/src/provider-config.js](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/src/provider-config.js)

The current shipping flow now:

- detects physical items
- builds a shipment estimate
- requests a USPS quote
- falls back to `shipping.fallback_flat_rate` if needed

### Frontend

The cart/manage UI can stay structurally similar:

- show shipping in summary rows
- continue collecting shipping address for physical orders
- no new user-facing carrier UI in v1

## Testing Strategy

Current automated coverage includes:

- unit coverage for shipment-shape aggregation
- unit coverage for USPS fallback behavior
- unit coverage for quantity-sensitive physical shipping math
- Worker contract tests for checkout start / modify with:
  - domestic success
  - international success
  - USPS timeout/failure fallback
- E2E coverage for:
  - physical checkout quote path
  - modify-pledge shipping recalculation
- accessibility regression coverage for any new shipping-only UI states
- localized-path coverage to ensure shipping summaries and errors stay translated on seeded locales

## Documentation and Policy Updates

Current docs that should stay aligned with shipping behavior:

- [README.md](/docs/overview/platform/)
- [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](/docs/development/customization-guide/)
- [docs/DEV_NOTES.md](/docs/development/developer-notes/)
- [docs/TESTING.md](/docs/operations/testing/)
- [terms.md](/docs/overview/terms-and-guidelines/)

Terms should stop promising a flat physical shipping fee and instead describe deployment-configured shipping rules, including carrier-rated quotes and fallback rates where applicable.

Privacy wording may also need a small update if destination details are sent to USPS for quote calculation.

## Current Rule Tree

### 1. Build shipment buckets first

The Worker does not quote one giant cart blindly. It first splits the cart into operational shipment buckets:

- each campaign shipment follows that campaign's shipping rules
- campaign add-ons join the owning campaign shipment and inherit that campaign's overrides
- physical global add-ons do **not** borrow campaign shipping; they combine into one separate platform shipment
- digital items never create a shipment on their own

This is why a mixed cart can legitimately have:

- one or more campaign shipment quotes
- plus one platform shipment quote for physical global add-ons

### 2. Short-circuit deterministic shipping before USPS

The Worker skips live USPS when the result is already known:

- a campaign with an explicit `shipping_fallback_flat_rate` uses that campaign override directly for that campaign shipment
- qualifying domestic `manual_domestic_rate` presets use the explicit manual table directly

Right now that manual path is used for:

- `sticker`
- `signed_script`

Those items only use the manual flat table when the full shipment still qualifies by weight and dimensions. If not, the Worker falls through to the live USPS path.

### 3. If a quote is still needed, try the preset's cheapest valid class order

When a shipment is not already determined by an override or manual table, the Worker uses the preset metadata to try the cheapest defensible class first.

Current implemented ordering:

- `sticker`
  - manual `FIRST_CLASS_FLAT`
  - otherwise cheaper single-piece domestic USPS profile
  - otherwise normal parcel quote path
- `signed_script`
  - manual `FIRST_CLASS_FLAT`
  - otherwise `MEDIA_MAIL`
  - otherwise `USPS_GROUND_ADVANTAGE`
  - otherwise `PRIORITY_MAIL`
- `cd`, `dvd`, `bluray`
  - `MEDIA_MAIL`
  - then `USPS_GROUND_ADVANTAGE`
  - then `PRIORITY_MAIL`
- everything else
  - default live USPS parcel-style quote path

If a shipment mixes incompatible preset profiles, the Worker intentionally falls back to the safer default parcel model instead of trying to get too clever and underquote.

### 4. USPS delivery options layer on top of the base quote

The backer-facing selector is intentionally narrow:

- `Standard`
- `Signature required`
- `Adult signature required`

Rules:

- `Standard` defaults to the cheapest eligible shipping option
- signature options are domestic-only
- the selector is only shown when the shipment still needs a live USPS quote and the underlying shipment supports those options
- the selected delivery option is persisted and reused by Manage Pledge, saved totals, reports, and supporter emails

### 5. Fallback only applies when the quote path actually fails

The deployment fallback is still:

- `shipping.fallback_flat_rate: 3.00`

But that fallback should only appear when:

- USPS is unavailable
- USPS returns no usable rate
- the shipment has no more specific valid override or manual-table path

The platform should not show the `$3.00` fallback as a fake estimate when we simply have not quoted yet.

## Cart and Checkout Behavior

### ZIP field visibility

The cart only asks for a ZIP when at least one shipment still needs a live quote.

Hide the ZIP field when:

- every physical shipment in the cart is covered by explicit campaign flat-rate overrides
- or every physical shipment in the cart is covered by deterministic manual flat-rate items such as `sticker` / `signed_script`

Show the ZIP field when:

- any campaign shipment still needs live USPS rating
- or the platform shipment for physical global add-ons still needs live USPS rating

### Estimate mode

When a ZIP is required but has not been fully entered yet, the UI should stay in estimate mode:

- `Estimated shipping`
- `--`
- `Estimated total`
- subtotal + tip + tax only

This applies both in the cart sidecar and the hosted/on-site checkout preview.

Partial postal input should also remain in estimate mode. The cart should not briefly flash the flat fallback while the user is still typing.

### Known shipping states in the UI

The frontend should distinguish between these states:

- known flat-rate shipment
  - no ZIP field if no live quote is needed
  - shipping amount shown immediately
- live-quote-required shipment without full ZIP/postal input
  - estimate mode
- live-quote-required shipment with complete ZIP/postal input
  - Worker quote shown
  - optional delivery-option selector shown when supported
- USPS failure
  - configured fallback shown instead of blocking checkout

## Current Acceptance State

The shipping implementation is in good shape when:

- domestic and international physical pledges can use USPS live rating through the Worker
- campaign flat-rate overrides short-circuit USPS for those campaign shipments
- qualifying manual-rate items like `sticker` and `signed_script` skip USPS and use the documented flat table
- campaign add-ons inherit the owning campaign's shipping rules and overrides
- physical global add-ons combine into one separate platform shipment instead of borrowing campaign shipping
- quantity changes affect shipment math correctly
- checkout, Manage Pledge, saved pledge totals, emails, reports, and fulfillment exports stay aligned on the stored shipping amount
- ZIP-required carts stay in estimate mode until the postal code is complete
- no security regressions are introduced into checkout or pledge modification
- no accessibility regressions are introduced into shipping-related checkout/manage states
- no new English-only site-owned shipping copy is introduced on localized routes
