# Merge Smoke Checklist

## Last Updated

July 5, 2026

Use this checklist before merging branches that change checkout, webhook persistence, pledge management, inventory, settlement, or supporter broadcasts.

## Environment

Set these for the operator shell before starting:

```bash
export STAGING_SITE_URL="https://pool-staging.example.com"
export STAGING_WORKER_URL="https://pledge-staging.example.com"
export ADMIN_SECRET="..."
```

If the staging site and Worker share the same domain pattern in your setup, use the real staging URLs instead of the placeholders above.

If no staging environment exists, point these variables at local dev instead:

```bash
export STAGING_SITE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4000"
export STAGING_WORKER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8787"
export ADMIN_SECRET="..."
```

In that case, run `./scripts/dev.sh --podman` first and record in the sign-off that merge relied on the automated gate plus local smoke coverage because no staging environment exists.

## Local Rehearsal

Before a staging pass, or instead of one when no staging exists, you can rehearse most of the flow locally with:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh --podman
```

That script starts:

- Jekyll on `http://127.0.0.1:4000`
- the Worker on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`
- Stripe CLI webhook forwarding to the local Worker

Use local rehearsal to sanity-check checkout, webhook delivery, manage-link behavior, and admin endpoints before running the same flow against staging.

For dashboard-heavy branches, open the local dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/admin/`. The dev stack seeds the bootstrap admin defaults documented in `README.md` and `worker/README.md`; user-management changes made in the dashboard save to local Worker KV and are reset with local KV state.

For admin-dashboard UI changes, switch between top-level tabs, select a non-default Settings section, select a Campaigns campaign and non-default Campaigns subtab, reload the page, and confirm the same allowed workspace is restored. Then sign in as or simulate a campaign-scoped user and confirm super-admin-only tabs are not restored.

For local-only pledge management checks, use the `smoke-editable` campaign. It is defined as `test_only: true`, so it shows up in local development when `_config.local.yml` enables `show_test_campaigns`, while staying excluded from the production homepage and production `/api/campaigns.json`.

Before testing deployment surfaces, run the setup helper in dry-run mode and confirm it plans Cloudflare/GitHub changes without mutating anything:

```bash
npm run setup:deploy -- --mode=production --dry-run --skip-auth --skip-secrets
```

Use `--skip-readiness` for a narrow local-only rehearsal, or leave readiness enabled when you want the helper to perform read-only GitHub, Wrangler, Stripe, Resend, USPS, and ZIP.TAX checks with whatever provider credentials are available. The unit suite also includes fake-CLI coverage for the setup helper, so merge-gate testing should catch regressions in dry-run planning, KV reuse/create behavior, local secret generation, and generated Worker secret writes before live smoke.

For release sign-off, capture the combined evidence wrapper output:

```bash
npm run release:smoke -- --evidence-file /tmp/pool-release-smoke.md
```

Use focused reruns such as `npm run release:a11y-evidence`, `npm run release:i18n-seo-evidence`, `npm run release:pledge-evidence`, `npm run release:providers -- --no-dev-vars`, and `npm run release:payment-smoke -- --no-dev-vars` when a release note needs narrower evidence.

Recommended local setup for modify/cancel smoke:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/test/setup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"smoke-local@example.com","campaignSlug":"smoke-editable"}' | jq
```

Or run the end-to-end local mutate/cancel check directly:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-pledge-management.sh
```

## Test Data Setup

Prepare or identify:

1. One live staging campaign with:
   - at least one standard tier
   - one limited tier
   - one threshold-gated tier if available
   - at least one support item if available
2. One supporter email inbox you can receive mail in.
3. One second supporter email inbox for multi-pledge and inventory checks.
4. Seeded pledges for settlement testing:
   - one active pledge with valid Stripe customer/payment method
   - one active pledge intentionally missing `stripeCustomerId`
5. A campaign with enough supporters to cross pagination boundaries, if available.

## Pass / Fail Rule

Treat any of these as merge blockers:

- checkout succeeds but persists the wrong pledge shape
- modify/cancel breaks pledge totals, stats, or tier inventory
- a single magic link can still enumerate or modify another order
- settlement marks a campaign complete while active pledges still need attention
- milestone, diary, or announcement sends miss supporters or duplicate unexpectedly

## Checklist

### 1. Checkout Start

1. Open a live staging campaign page.
2. Add a normal tier and proceed to checkout.
3. Confirm the browser reaches the on-site Stripe payment step successfully, or the hosted fallback path if that mode is intentionally enabled.
4. Expected result:
   - no console errors on the campaign page
   - the checkout summary matches the selected tier, support items, custom amount, and tip
   - if the selected tier is scarce and near exhaustion, checkout start can hold it immediately

### 2. Checkout Completion

1. Complete a real staging/test checkout for a single pledge.
2. Verify the success page loads.
3. Verify the pledge exists in the Worker-backed data and the supporter can open the manage link from email.
4. Expected result:
   - webhook persists the pledge once
   - stored tier/add-on/custom amount match the actual checkout session
   - stats endpoint reflects the new subtotal

Helpful checks:

```bash
curl -s "$STAGING_WORKER_URL/stats/<campaign-slug>" | jq
curl -s "$STAGING_WORKER_URL/inventory/<campaign-slug>" | jq
```

### 3. Magic Link Scope

1. Create or identify two pledges for the same supporter email.
2. Open the manage link from the first pledge email.
3. Attempt to view or act on the second pledge from that same session/link.
4. Expected result:
   - the link can manage only its own order
   - other pledges on the same email are not listed or modifiable through that token

### 4. Modify Flow

1. Modify an uncharged pledge:
   - change the base tier if allowed
   - adjust quantity if allowed
   - add or remove support items
   - add or remove custom support
2. Verify the updated totals in the manage UI and in stored data.
3. Expected result:
   - subtotal, tax, tip, and final amount update coherently
   - pledge history records the modification
   - stats and inventory reflect the new pledge state

### 5. Cancel Flow

1. Cancel an uncharged pledge through its own manage link.
2. Re-check stats and inventory.
3. Expected result:
   - pledge moves to cancelled state
   - subtotal is removed from campaign stats
   - limited inventory is released

### 6. Limited Inventory Behavior

1. Start checkout for a limited tier but do **not** complete payment.
2. From a second browser/profile, start checkout for the same last-unit limited tier.
3. Expected result:
   - the second checkout is blocked or sold out while the first reservation is still active
   - public inventory remains the projection of committed claims, so the user-facing sold-out behavior may lead the public claimed count briefly
   - successful webhook persistence confirms the held reservation instead of re-claiming against a separate truth source

### 7. Threshold-Gated Tier Behavior

1. Try to purchase a threshold-gated tier before the threshold is met.
2. If possible, repeat after seeding enough support to cross the threshold.
3. Expected result:
   - before threshold: selection is rejected/disabled
   - after threshold: selection succeeds normally

### 8. Settlement Dry Run

1. Run a settlement dry run for a funded test campaign.
2. Verify the response shows supporters and skipped records accurately.
3. Expected result:
   - active pledges missing Stripe customer data are surfaced as skipped/needing attention
   - no completion marker is created by dry run

Example:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dryRun":true}' \
  "$STAGING_WORKER_URL/admin/settle/<campaign-slug>" | jq
```

### 9. Settlement Live Run

1. Run live settlement on seeded staging data or a dedicated test campaign.
2. Inspect the response and follow-up status.
3. Expected result:
   - campaigns with skipped active pledges do **not** get a final `campaign-charged` marker
   - campaigns with no unresolved work do mark as settled
   - successful charges send the expected post-charge emails

Preferred endpoint for larger campaigns:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  "$STAGING_WORKER_URL/admin/settle-dispatch/<campaign-slug>" | jq
```

### 10. Customer Backfill

1. Run customer backfill for a campaign with known missing `stripeCustomerId` values.
2. Expected result:
   - all qualifying pledges across KV pagination are updated
   - rerunning settlement after backfill reduces or clears skipped customer records

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' \
  "$STAGING_WORKER_URL/admin/backfill-customers/<campaign-slug>" | jq
```

### 11. Broadcast and Pagination Checks

Run these against a campaign with enough supporters to test pagination if possible.

1. Announcement dry run.
2. Diary check or diary broadcast.
3. Milestone check or milestone broadcast.
4. Expected result:
   - recipient counts include the full supporter set
   - no obvious truncation to a first page of results
   - no duplicate milestone send from a repeated or overlapping check

Examples:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"campaignSlug":"<campaign-slug>","subject":"Smoke Test","body":"Dry run","dryRun":true}' \
  "$STAGING_WORKER_URL/admin/broadcast/announcement" | jq

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  "$STAGING_WORKER_URL/admin/milestone-check/<campaign-slug>" | jq
```

### 12. Admin Dashboard Smoke

Run this section when the branch changes dashboard UI, admin Worker routes, campaign configuration, add-ons, uploads, reporting, analytics, supporters, marketing tools, or user management.

1. Sign in to `/admin/` with an authorized admin email.
2. Verify the main tabs render without horizontal overflow at desktop, tablet, and mobile widths.
3. In **Settings**, confirm publishable sections show a disabled `Publish` button until a real change is made. Confirm **Users**, **Plan usage**, **Secrets & credentials**, and **Runtime diagnostics** do not show an unused publish action.
4. In **Settings -> Users**, create or edit a campaign user, save, and confirm the change takes effect without a GitHub publish flow.
5. In **Settings -> Plan usage**, verify usage loads automatically, there is no `Refresh usage` button, Cloudflare/Resend headings have readable help text, and the cards do not overflow on mobile.
6. In **Campaigns**, switch campaign subtabs and verify content, tiers, campaign add-ons, diary entries, and decisions load for the selected campaign only.
7. As a super admin, verify the Campaigns sidebar first row is the `+` button, create a preview-only campaign with multiple existing/new campaign users, and confirm assigned users receive the dashboard-link email when Resend is configured.
8. In **Content**, verify **Publish** and **Preview** appear together. Publish a protected preview, confirm the dashboard shows the current user's preview link, add optional reviewer emails, confirm the email copy says the link expires in 24 hours, and confirm previewer emails are not written to campaign Markdown or public JSON.
9. In **Content** and **Diary Entries**, add/edit a content block, verify WYSIWYG preview behavior, open the image-block media picker, confirm campaign users see only campaign media, and confirm `Save Draft` only enables when the local draft differs from the saved value.
10. In **Add-ons** and campaign **Add-Ons**, verify physical products show shipping preset / package fields, digital products hide shipping fields, and product/variant IDs derive from names/labels for new entries.
11. In **Analytics**, **Reports**, and **Supporters**, verify the default `All` view only shows campaigns available to the current admin, gross and net revenue amounts show exact cents where applicable, referral/UTM source/medium/campaign/content breakdowns load from indexed pledges, and CSV export matches the visible rows.
12. In **Marketing**, save/edit/delete a referral code, verify the URL builder clears after save/refresh, confirm the QR preview updates from the current campaign URL, download PNG/SVG QR files, use **Save shared draft** / **Load shared draft** / **Clear shared draft**, confirm abandoned-checkout health loads without KV listing, verify admin-created suppression rows show the suppressed email with a Clear action, and confirm the embedded campaign builder still works.
13. In first-party checkout, confirm the abandoned-checkout reminder box is unchecked by default, uses benefit copy, persists after being checked, and signed reminder links restore the abandoned cart/contact draft before starting a fresh Stripe session.
14. In **Campaigns -> Blast**, draft a supporter email blast with text plus a hosted image, selected existing image, or YouTube/Vimeo block; use **Save shared draft** / **Load shared draft** / **Clear shared draft**; click **Send test** and verify the automatic dry-run returns an audience count/hash before the test email goes to the signed-in admin. Then click **Send blast**, confirm the live send, and verify sent history records subject, content, CTA Button Label, and CTA Button URL below the editor. Use a campaign with a rebuilt `campaign-pledges:<slug>` index; missing indexes should fail closed with `campaign_index_required` before any email send.
15. For `/es/admin/`, verify translated tab labels, Plan usage labels/links, Create new campaign / Preview copy, and tablet/mobile navigation do not overflow.
