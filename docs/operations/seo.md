# SEO

## Last Updated

June 11, 2026

This document describes The Pool's current SEO model in 2026. It is intentionally conservative: public pages are made easier to crawl and understand, while supporter-only and tokenized flows stay out of index intent. The implementation is designed around real metadata, real public pages, and honest structured data rather than content padding or rich-result bait.

## Principles

- strengthen discoverability of real public pages and campaign pages
- keep the fork-facing SEO surface small and trustworthy
- preserve accessibility, privacy, and security boundaries
- avoid SEO tactics that create thin, misleading, or junk content

## Current Implementation

The current baseline includes:

- shared metadata includes for public pages and public campaign pages
- alternate-language metadata on localized public pages and localized campaign pages
- canonical URLs on public layouts
- locale-aware Open Graph metadata on public layouts
- campaign pages now use `og:type=article` plus bounded article publish/modified timestamps derived from campaign content dates
- explicit language/app-name metadata on public layouts
- page-level descriptions on core public routes
- Open Graph and Twitter card metadata
- secure social-image tags where the page image is already HTTPS
- social image alt metadata
- state-aware campaign social titles and descriptions
- state-aware campaign share-link intent text for platforms that accept message copy, while Facebook and other card-first destinations keep relying on the page URL and Open Graph metadata
- public campaign diary hash links activate the matching diary phase tab before scrolling, so anchors into hidden panels such as `#diary-production` remain valid share/email targets
- Worker-generated campaign share-card PNGs for public social metadata, with SVG retained for internal preview/debug tooling
- generated [`robots.txt`](/robots.txt)
- generated [`sitemap.xml`](/sitemap.xml)
- explicit `noindex,nofollow` on tokenized or supporter-only layouts
- explicit `noindex,nofollow,noarchive`, `sitemap: false`, robots disallows, and disabled social metadata on the private admin dashboard
- conservative `Organization` / `WebSite` JSON-LD
- conservative campaign `CreativeWork` plus breadcrumb JSON-LD, both aligned with the active page language where supported
- campaign `CreativeWork` JSON-LD now also includes `headline`, `mainEntityOfPage`, `isPartOf`, and published/modified timestamps so public campaign pages read more like real editorial landing pages than anonymous blobs
- a public community hub that links back to public campaign pages instead of pushing crawlers into supporter-only routes

The main implementation files are:

- [/_includes/seo-meta.html](../_includes/seo-meta.html)
- [/_includes/seo-json-ld.html](../_includes/seo-json-ld.html)
- [/_layouts/campaign.html](../_layouts/campaign.html)
- [/worker/src/index.js](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/src/index.js)
- [/robots.txt](/robots.txt)
- [/sitemap.xml](/sitemap.xml)

Campaign social previews default to a Worker-generated, crawler-friendly PNG that uses live campaign progress. A campaign can still override that with `social_image` when it needs a fixed static raster image, ideally JPEG or PNG at `1200 x 630`.

The public Open Graph route is:

- `/share/campaign/{slug}.png?lang=en`
- `/share/campaign/{slug}.png?lang=es`

That route generates a state-aware SVG card from live campaign data, then rasterizes it to PNG so shared links stay crawler-safe while still showing pledged total, goal progress, campaign state, and the campaign's square `hero_image` with the richer share-card styling. The Worker also keeps the SVG version at `/share/campaign/{slug}.svg?lang={lang}` for internal preview/debug tooling, but SVG is not the public metadata default because some external crawlers reject it.

Campaign page share links keep the same separation of concerns:

- Open Graph and Twitter metadata control crawler previews and share-card images.
- Platform share URLs include richer, state-aware intent text only where the destination supports message text.
- Share URLs preserve only safe UTM/referral query params and do not add image URLs or private state to the shared URL.

## Indexing Contract

Indexable by default:

- home
- about
- terms
- public campaign pages
- public post-campaign pages that still have discovery value
- the public community hub when `seo.index_public_community_hub` is enabled

Non-indexable by default:

- cart and checkout flows
- pledge success / cancelled pages
- `/manage/`
- `/admin/`
- `/es/admin/`
- supporter community pages
- tokenized routes and user-specific query-string access paths

This is enforced through a mix of:

- layout-level robots meta tags
- `robots.txt`
- sitemap inclusion rules
- sitemap `lastmod` hints for public pages and campaigns

Admin dashboard contract:

- [admin.md](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/admin.md) and [es/admin/index.html](../es/admin/index.html) must keep `indexable: false` and `sitemap: false`
- [/_layouts/admin.html](../_layouts/admin.html) must call `seo-meta.html` with `indexable=false` and `social=false`
- [`robots.txt`](/robots.txt) must disallow `/admin/` and `/es/admin/`
- [`sitemap.xml`](/sitemap.xml) must not include admin routes
- the admin layout must not emit JSON-LD or Open Graph/Twitter social-preview metadata; the dashboard is a private app surface, not a public search result or share target

## Structured Data

The site only emits schema types that map cleanly to visible content and real data:

- `Organization`
- `WebSite`
- `BreadcrumbList`
- campaign-level `CreativeWork`

The implementation intentionally does not emit:

- fake FAQ schema
- fake reviews or star ratings
- product/offer schema that overstates what the page actually represents

## Supported SEO Config Surface

The fork-facing SEO surface is intentionally bounded. Current supported settings include:

- top-level `title`
- top-level `description`
- `platform.name`
- `platform.site_url`
- `platform.default_social_image_path`
- `seo.x_handle`
- `seo.same_as`
- `seo.index_public_community_hub`
- `seo.default_social_image_alt`
- `seo.og_locale_overrides`
- public-page front matter `title` / `description`
- campaign content fields such as `title`, `short_blurb`, `creator_name`, `category`, and hero imagery

This keeps the SEO model variable-first without opening up a huge matrix of fragile or unsupported knobs.

Public metadata also derives a few safe values automatically:

- `og:locale` from the active page language
- `og:locale:alternate` from the supported translated languages for that page
- `language`, `application-name`, and `apple-mobile-web-app-title` from the active site/page identity
- `og:image:alt` / `twitter:image:alt` from explicit image alt text when present, otherwise the page title
- `og:image:secure_url` when the chosen social image already resolves to HTTPS
- `article:published_time` / `article:modified_time` on campaign pages when campaign dates are available
- campaign preview copy from campaign state (`upcoming`, `live`, `funded`, `ended`)
- campaign preview images from `social_image` when configured, otherwise the Worker-generated PNG share-card route
- `WebSite.availableLanguage`, localized breadcrumb roots, and campaign `CreativeWork.inLanguage` from the configured locale model

Forks can override part of that behavior in a bounded way:

- `seo.default_social_image_alt` supplies the fallback alt text for default social images
- `seo.og_locale_overrides` maps language codes to explicit Open Graph locale strings

Example:

```yml
seo:
  x_handle: dustwave
  same_as:
    - https://www.instagram.com/dustwave
    - https://www.youtube.com/@dustwave
  index_public_community_hub: true
  default_social_image_alt: "Social card for your deployment"
  og_locale_overrides:
    en: en_US
    es: es_ES
```

## What Forks Can Safely Change

Forks can safely customize:

- site identity and default metadata
- organization social-profile links
- whether the public community hub should remain indexable
- page and campaign descriptive copy that already exists in the content model
- campaign preview inputs that already exist in the content model, such as campaign title, the first long-content text block used for social descriptions, category, creator, a `funded: true` flag for successful post-campaign metadata before settlement, and the square hero image used inside generated share cards

Forks should not assume support for:

- arbitrary per-page SEO config matrices
- custom schema taxonomies beyond the documented surface
- indexing of private or tokenized supporter flows

## Validation Checklist

When checking a deployment manually:

- page source for home/about/terms/campaign pages has correct title, description, canonical, OG, and Twitter tags
- campaign pages emit a crawler-friendly `social_image` when configured, otherwise the Worker share-card PNG route
- visible campaign share links use the canonical campaign URL and do not replace the metadata-driven social card contract
- `robots.txt` is reachable and only exposes intended public crawl paths
- `sitemap.xml` is reachable and only includes intended public URLs
- private/tokenized pages emit `noindex` where appropriate
- `/admin/` and `/es/admin/` emit `noindex,nofollow,noarchive`, do not appear in `sitemap.xml`, and do not emit social-preview or JSON-LD metadata
- JSON-LD validates cleanly
- localized pages keep coherent canonical and alternate links
- localized campaign pages keep coherent canonical and alternate links
- localized pages keep coherent JSON-LD language and breadcrumb roots
- metadata additions do not create accessibility or performance regressions

## Notes

This implementation was guided by Google Search Central guidance around:

- canonicalization
- robots meta usage
- sitemap construction
- structured data basics
- breadcrumb structured data

The core rule remains simple: public metadata should reflect visible public content, and private/supporter-only flows should stay outside search intent.
