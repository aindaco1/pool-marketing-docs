# The Pool - Pledge Worker

Cloudflare Worker handling first-party checkout canonicalization, Stripe integration, pledge management, and order-scoped supporter authentication.

For day-to-day local development, prefer the repo-root Podman path:

```bash
npm run podman:doctor
./scripts/dev.sh --podman
```

That boots the site and Worker together on the standard local ports and is the easiest way to exercise the full on-site checkout and `Update Card` flows locally.

If you specifically work from the `worker/` directory, the Worker npm scripts now auto-run the config mirror first so `worker/wrangler.toml` stays aligned with the repo-root `_config.yml` / `_config.local.yml`.

Treat `_config.local.yml` as an override-only file for localhost-specific values. The canonical fork-facing settings should live in the repo-root `_config.yml`, and the Worker mirror will follow from there.

The mirrored Worker config now also includes the shared debug flags:

- `DEBUG_CONSOLE_LOGGING_ENABLED`
- `DEBUG_VERBOSE_CONSOLE_LOGGING`

Those come from `debug.console_logging_enabled` and `debug.verbose_console_logging` in the repo-root [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml), and both default to `true` so local and deployed Workers stay verbose unless a fork explicitly turns logging down.

Worker-side stats and inventory repair now also treat `campaign-pledges:{slug}` as projection state instead of permanent truth. If a campaign index drifts from the underlying active pledge records, the recalc paths repair it automatically while rebuilding campaign totals and limited-tier inventory.

Before mutating anything, operators can now run read-only drift checks through:

- `POST /stats/:slug/check`
- `POST /admin/projections/check`
- [`scripts/check-projections.sh`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/scripts/check-projections.sh) from the repo root

Those checks compare stored `campaign-pledges:{slug}`, `stats:{slug}`, and `tier-inventory:{slug}` projections against active pledge truth and return a structured diff instead of silently repairing state.

The same “saved truth over draft state” rule now applies to platform add-ons: `_config.yml` defines the starting inventory baseline for each product or variant, while the Worker derives effective remaining inventory from saved pledge state and invalidates cached add-on inventory after pledge create, modify, or cancel events.

## Setup

### 1. Create KV Namespaces

```bash
cd worker

wrangler kv:namespace create "VOTES"
wrangler kv:namespace create "VOTES" --preview
wrangler kv:namespace create "PLEDGES"
wrangler kv:namespace create "PLEDGES" --preview
```

Update `wrangler.toml` with the returned IDs.

### 2. Configure Secrets

```bash
# Stripe API Keys
wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_LIVE
wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_TEST

# Stripe Webhook Secrets
wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_LIVE
wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TEST

# First-party checkout intent signing secret
wrangler secret put CHECKOUT_INTENT_SECRET

# Magic link token secret
wrangler secret put MAGIC_LINK_SECRET

# Email delivery
wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY

# Admin endpoints
wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET

# USPS OAuth secret (keep the client id in site config)
wrangler secret put USPS_CLIENT_SECRET
```

USPS setup for this repo is split intentionally:

- keep `shipping.usps.client_id` in the repo-root [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml) or [`_config.local.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.local.yml)
- keep `USPS_CLIENT_SECRET` in Worker secrets or [`worker/.dev.vars`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/.dev.vars)
- if you want to point the Worker at USPS TEM for testing, also set `shipping.usps.api_base` or `USPS_API_BASE`

The Pool currently only needs USPS OAuth plus the default pricing/shipping-options product set for live quote calculation. It does **not** require USPS Labels / Ship / EPA setup unless the project later grows into label generation.

Example local `worker/.dev.vars` file:

```dotenv
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_TEST=sk_test_your_test_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TEST=whsec_your_test_webhook_secret
CHECKOUT_INTENT_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_string
MAGIC_LINK_SECRET=replace_with_a_different_long_random_string
RESEND_API_KEY=re_example_key
ADMIN_SECRET=replace_with_a_third_long_random_string
USPS_CLIENT_SECRET=replace_with_usps_client_secret
```

Notes:

- keep `worker/.dev.vars` untracked and gitignored
- use local/test secrets here, not live production credentials
- `./scripts/dev.sh --podman` may auto-generate or update some local-only values such as `CHECKOUT_INTENT_SECRET` or the Stripe webhook secret during development

### 3. Configure Stripe Webhooks

1. Go to [Stripe Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Add endpoint: `https://worker.example.com/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy the signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_LIVE`
5. Repeat for test mode with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TEST`

### 4. Deploy / Run

For full local development, prefer the repo-root Podman path above. If you specifically need to run only the Worker on the host:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Deploy with:

```bash
npm run deploy
npm run deploy:worker
```

On GitHub, pushes to `main` also deploy the Worker automatically through `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The preferred setup uses repository secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. As a temporary fallback, the workflow also accepts legacy Cloudflare auth via `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` and `CLOUDFLARE_KEY`.

## API Endpoints

### POST /checkout-intent/start
Canonicalize the first-party cart payload and create a Stripe setup-mode Checkout Session for a new pledge.

```json
{
  "campaignSlug": "hand-relations",
  "items": [
    { "id": "hand-relations__producer-credit", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "customAmount": 0,
  "email": "supporter@example.com",
  "tipPercent": 5,
  "shippingAddress": {
    "country": "US",
    "postalCode": "87120"
  },
  "shippingOption": "standard"
}
```

Returns either a custom-session bootstrap (`checkoutUiMode`, `sessionId`, `clientSecret`, `publishableKey`, `orderId`) or a hosted fallback URL.

The Worker rebuilds tier, bundle add-on, custom-support, shipping, and subtotal state from first-party cart items, validates campaign state and inventory, signs a short-lived checkout snapshot, reserves scarce inventory for limited tiers before the payment step completes, and confirms those reservations when the pledge is actually persisted. For physical pledges or physical add-ons, shipping is Worker-calculated from destination plus campaign/item shipping metadata, using USPS live quotes when available and deployment or campaign fallback rates when not.

When a pledge qualifies for shipping upgrades, the Worker also persists the selected limited delivery option (`standard`, `signature_required`, or `adult_signature_required`) so the cart, Manage Pledge, stored pledge total, and supporter emails stay aligned.

Limited-tier reservations and claims are serialized through a per-campaign Durable Object coordinator before the KV inventory snapshot is updated, so concurrent checkout starts, retries, modifications, and webhook completions cannot oversell scarce rewards.

### GET /pledges?token={token}
Get the pledge(s) authorized by a magic link token.

Current behavior: the token returns only its own authorized order.

### GET /pledge?token={token}
Get single pledge details (legacy endpoint).

### POST /pledge/cancel
Cancel an active pledge.

```json
{
  "token": "magic-link-token",
  "orderId": "pool-intent-abc123"
}
```

### POST /pledge/modify
Change tiers, quantity, or custom support for an active pledge.

```json
{
  "token": "magic-link-token",
  "orderId": "pool-intent-abc123",
  "newTierId": "sfx-slot",
  "newTierQty": 2,
  "addTiers": [{ "id": "frame", "qty": 5 }],
  "customAmount": 25
}
```

All fields except `token` are optional. Changes are tracked in the pledge's `history` array with `type: "modified"` entries that include tier state, bundle add-on changes, `customAmount`, shipping deltas, and any selected shipping option.

The Worker validates the requested order against the token payload and recalculates totals from stored pledge state plus campaign definitions. Same-price structural changes, such as an add-on variant swap, still count as real pledge changes for persistence and supporter email purposes.

### POST /stats/:slug/check
Run a read-only projection drift check for one campaign.

Requires admin auth and returns whether the stored campaign index, stats projection, and tier inventory projection are still in sync with active pledge truth.

### POST /admin/projections/check
Run the same read-only drift check across all campaigns.

This is the Worker-side endpoint that powers [`scripts/check-projections.sh`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/scripts/check-projections.sh) and the newer mutable-pledge smoke assertions.

## Content Safety Notes

- Campaign/diary text blocks accept Markdown plus a small inline HTML subset: `<br>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<b>`, `<u>`.
- Markdown links are rewritten unless they use an allowlisted destination scheme (`http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`, or internal links).
- External Markdown links automatically get `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Structured embeds only render when the provider URL is an approved `https://` Spotify, YouTube, or Vimeo embed URL.

### POST /pledge/payment-method/start
Start a Stripe session to update payment method.

```json
{
  "token": "magic-link-token"
}
```

Returns either a custom-session bootstrap for the on-site `Update Card` flow or a hosted fallback URL.

### GET /share/campaign/:slug.svg
Return a public SVG share card for one campaign.

Optional query params:

- `lang=en|es` to localize campaign UI copy and the footer campaign link

The rendered card uses live campaign data, including current state, pledged total, goal progress, and creator/category metadata. Campaign-page `og:image` / `twitter:image` tags point at this route so social previews stay aligned with live campaign and embed state.

### POST /webhooks/stripe
Stripe webhook endpoint (signature verified).

### POST /admin/broadcast/diary
Send diary update notification to all campaign supporters. Requires `x-admin-key` header.

```json
{
  "campaignSlug": "hand-relations",
  "diaryTitle": "Week 3 Update",
  "diaryExcerpt": "Optional preview text...",
  "dryRun": true  // Set to true to preview recipients without sending
}
```

### POST /admin/diary/check
Check all campaigns for new diary entries and broadcast them automatically. Called by GitHub Actions after deploy. Requires `Authorization: Bearer {ADMIN_SECRET}` header.

```json
{
  "dryRun": true  // Optional: preview without sending
}
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "checked": 2,
  "newEntries": [
    { "campaignSlug": "...", "campaignTitle": "...", "date": "2026-01-15", "title": "..." }
  ],
  "sent": 10,
  "failed": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

### POST /admin/broadcast/milestone
Send milestone notification to all campaign supporters. Requires `x-admin-key` header.

```json
{
  "campaignSlug": "hand-relations",
  "milestone": "one-third",  // "one-third", "two-thirds", "goal", or "stretch"
  "stretchGoalName": "Director's Commentary",  // Required for "stretch" milestone
  "dryRun": true
}
```

### POST /test/email
Send a test email of any type. In test mode (`APP_MODE=test`), no auth required. In production, requires `x-admin-key` header.

```json
{
  "type": "supporter",  // See types below
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "campaignSlug": "hand-relations"
}
```

Valid types:
- `supporter` - Pledge confirmation (with sample pledge items)
- `modified` - Pledge modification (with sample pledge items)
- `payment-failed` - Payment failure (with subtotal/tax breakdown and pledge items)
- `charge-success` - Charge success (with subtotal/tax breakdown and pledge items)
- `diary` - Diary update notification
- `milestone-one-third` - 1/3 goal milestone
- `milestone-two-thirds` - 2/3 goal milestone
- `milestone-goal` - Goal reached
- `milestone-stretch` - Stretch goal unlocked

**Production usage:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://worker.example.com/test/email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-admin-key: YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "type": "supporter", "campaignSlug": "hand-relations"}'
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SITE_BASE` | Base URL of the Jekyll site |
| `WORKER_BASE` | Public base URL of the Worker |

When `SITE_BASE` points at local dev (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`), embedded email images still fall back to the public `https://site.example.com` asset base so inbox clients do not receive broken localhost image URLs.

Fork note: treat those identity, pricing, and shipping vars as mirrors of the structured site config in [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml), especially the `platform`, `pricing`, and `shipping` sections. The first-party cart/runtime and the custom on-site checkout UI are built-in platform behavior now, not Worker env toggles you should normally customize.

Keep `USPS_CLIENT_SECRET` out of site config. It belongs in Worker secrets or [`worker/.dev.vars`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/.dev.vars).

Localization note: the Worker now localizes supporter-facing email subjects/body copy and localized `/manage/` / `/community/:slug/` links from the shared site locale catalog. In normal operation it fetches that catalog from `SITE_BASE/assets/i18n.json`; tests and advanced deployments can inject `I18N_CATALOG_JSON` instead. That means localized supporter emails and localized routes such as `/es/manage/` or `/es/community/:slug/` stay aligned with the site locale model when a deployment adds those routes.

The Worker also serves localized campaign share-card previews at `GET /share/campaign/:slug.svg` with an optional `?lang=es` query. Campaign pages use that route for their social image metadata, and the generated SVG mirrors the campaign embed's state/progress language while linking back to the localized public campaign route.

## Data Flow

1. **User pledges on campaign page**
   - first-party cart created with tier item
   - `POST /checkout-intent/start` creates the setup-mode Stripe session used by the on-site payment step
   - the existing checkout sidecar mounts secure Stripe payment UI to save the card

2. **Stripe webhook: checkout.session.completed**
   - Extract payment method and customer from SetupIntent
   - Persist pledge data in KV and update stats/inventory
   - Commit webhook idempotency only after successful persistence
   - Send confirmation email with an order-scoped magic link

3. **User manages pledge via /manage/?t={token}**
   - Frontend calls GET `/pledges`
   - The token can read/modify only its own authorized order
   - User can modify tier, cancel, or update payment method

4. **Campaign reaches goal**
   - Admin triggers charge process (separate script)
   - Creates PaymentIntents using stored payment methods
   - Updates pledge status to "charged"

## Test Mode

Preferred local development path:

```bash
npm run podman:doctor
./scripts/dev.sh --podman
```

That starts the site and the Worker together, and the Worker still runs with `--env dev` under the hood.

The broader automated browser path now builds and serves a static `_site`, so local headless checks exercise the same published-style asset layout as the site build rather than relying on `jekyll serve`.

If you specifically need the Worker-only fallback:

```bash
cd worker
wrangler dev --env dev
```

The `dev` environment:
- Sets `APP_MODE=test`
- Uses `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_TEST`
- Points `SITE_BASE` to localhost

Add `?dev` to the manage page URL for mock data: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/manage/?dev`

## Automated Diary Broadcasts

Diary entries are automatically broadcast to supporters when deployed:

1. When a new diary entry is added and the site is deployed, the `deploy.yml` GitHub Action calls `POST /admin/diary/check`
2. The worker fetches campaign data and compares diary entries against what's been sent
3. New entries are broadcast to all campaign supporters via email
4. Sent entries are tracked in KV (`diary-sent:{campaignSlug}`) to prevent duplicate emails

**Setup:** Ensure `ADMIN_SECRET` is set as a GitHub repository secret for the deploy action to authenticate.
