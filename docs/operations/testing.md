# Testing Guide

This guide covers the automated test suites, local test infrastructure, and manual verification paths.

## Quick Reference

```bash
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests (Vitest) — ~700ms
npm run test:unit:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:unit:coverage # With coverage report
npm run test:secrets       # Secret exposure audit for local env files
npm run test:premerge      # Merge-readiness checks for changed Worker logic
npm run test:e2e           # E2E tests (Playwright) — fully automated browser coverage
npm run test:e2e:headless  # CI mode
npm run test:e2e:headless:podman  # Automated browser suite with Playwright in Podman
npm run test:e2e:parity    # First-party critical-path browser flows
npm run podman:doctor      # Cross-platform Podman readiness check
npm run test:security      # Security pen tests (Worker must be running)
npm run test:security:podman  # Security pen tests with a one-shot Podman-backed stack
npm run test:security:staging  # Security tests against a staging worker, if you maintain one
./scripts/test-checkout.sh --podman  # Manual checkout helper against the Podman stack
./scripts/test-e2e.sh --podman       # Automated browser helper against the Podman stack
npm run test:usps          # Live USPS credential + quote sanity check
npm test                   # Run all tests
```

`./scripts/test-e2e.sh --podman` is now the fully automated browser path. Use `./scripts/test-checkout.sh --podman` when you specifically want to drive the checkout manually in a real browser.

For the accessibility-focused browser slice, use:

```bash
./scripts/podman-playwright-run.sh npx playwright test \
  tests/e2e/accessibility-public-pages.spec.ts \
  tests/e2e/manage-flows.spec.ts \
  tests/e2e/community-flows.spec.ts \
  tests/e2e/public-page-controls.spec.ts \
  tests/e2e/campaign-checkout.spec.ts \
  --project=chromium \
  --grep "Public Page Accessibility|keyboard-only|Community Flows|Public Page Keyboard Controls"
```

If you want just the public accessibility regression sweep and do not want to depend on host Ruby/Bundler, prefer the Podman-backed path:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headless:podman -- tests/e2e/accessibility-public-pages.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

---

## Pre-Merge Regression Runbook

Use this before merging branches that touch checkout, Worker business logic, fulfillment, or broadcast flows.

### Automated Gate

```bash
npm run test:premerge
```

This runs:

- `npm run test:secrets` to verify local env files stay ignored and their secret values do not appear in tracked files or git history
- `node --check` for the changed Worker entrypoints
- Focused regression suites:
  - `tests/unit/worker-business-logic.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/worker-ops-integrity.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/stats-pagination.test.ts`
- Content safety filter regressions in `tests/unit/content-safety-filter.test.ts`, including unsafe Markdown link schemes and strict structured-embed URL validation
- Campaign-content audit coverage in `tests/unit/campaign-content-security.test.ts`, including the allowed inline HTML subset and rejection of disallowed raw tags
- Durable Object tier-inventory serialization coverage in `tests/unit/tier-inventory-do.test.ts`
- Local smoke scripts against the test-only mutable campaign:
  - `scripts/test-worker.sh` for site/Worker contract checks and malformed `/checkout-intent/start` verification
  - `scripts/smoke-pledge-management.sh` for successful modify/cancel coverage on the local-only mutable campaign, using admin rebuild responses plus read-only projection drift checks as the authoritative stats/inventory source during the smoke
    The script now rotates its synthetic admin request IPs during those rebuild/check calls so the real admin rate limiter does not create a false negative in local merge gating.
- Full unit suite via `npm run test:unit`
- Security suite via `npm run test:security` against an auto-started local Worker
- Podman-backed security suite via `npm run test:security:podman` when you want the site/Worker stack booted and exercised in the same invocation
- Playwright headless E2E via `npm run test:e2e:headless`

The pre-merge script now auto-starts Jekyll with `_config.yml,_config.local.yml` when needed so the local-only `smoke-editable` campaign is available during merge gating, and the Playwright harness uses the same combined config locally.
That gate now tries the host Bundler/Jekyll path first, including a one-time `bundle install` attempt when Bundler is present but gems are missing. It keeps the lighter host Worker smoke, but runs the mutable-pledge smoke through the Podman-backed stack so the stateful modify/cancel path uses isolated local service state even when the host build path succeeds. If the host Ruby path still cannot build cleanly, it falls back to a Podman-backed Jekyll build plus the remaining Podman-aware smoke/browser helpers instead of failing on host setup alone.
For headless browser runs, Playwright now builds a static `_site` and serves that output with a lightweight HTTP server instead of using `jekyll serve`, which keeps automated browser checks closer to the real published asset layout.

This branch now defaults to the first-party cart/runtime path in both `_config.yml` and `_config.local.yml`, and the browser path no longer supports the old hosted-cart runtime.

Recent security hardening that the gate now covers includes:

- fail-closed `GET /pledge` behavior when a magic-link token exists but the pledge row does not
- Markdown link-scheme neutralization in long-form content
- exact-origin validation for structured embeds (`spotify`, `youtube`, `vimeo`)
- serialized limited-tier inventory reservations at checkout start and confirmation at successful persistence time

The local Worker defaults in [worker/wrangler.toml](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/wrangler.toml) now match that first-party setup. `./scripts/dev.sh --podman` now auto-generates a local `CHECKOUT_INTENT_SECRET` in `worker/.dev.vars` if it is missing, so fresh local checkout starts do not fail closed on an uninitialized dev secret.

For local work, prefer `./scripts/dev.sh --podman`. It starts Jekyll and the Worker in rootless Podman containers while preserving the same ports and local Wrangler state.

[`_config.local.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.local.yml) is now an override-only layer, not a second base config. When you change or add fork-facing settings, prefer [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml) unless the value should truly differ only on your local machine.

The browser helper scripts support the same mode:

```bash
./scripts/test-checkout.sh --podman
./scripts/test-e2e.sh --podman
./scripts/test-worker.sh --podman
./scripts/smoke-pledge-management.sh --podman
./scripts/pledge-report.sh --podman --local
./scripts/fulfillment-report.sh --podman --local
```

Those helpers still run Playwright and shell smoke logic on the host for now, but they boot the site and Worker through the shared Podman-backed local stack first. The report scripts can now run directly through the Worker container as well. That keeps local testing and exports closer to production-like service boundaries without forcing host Ruby or host Wrangler setup.

For host-side commands that need the Podman-backed stack but should not depend on detached stack persistence across separate shells, use [`scripts/podman-stack-run.sh`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/scripts/podman-stack-run.sh). `npm run test:security:podman` uses that wrapper.

For a mostly host-independent browser path, `npm run test:e2e:headless:podman` now runs the automated Playwright suite inside a dedicated Podman container on the same local pod network as the site and Worker.

Recent browser coverage also includes dedicated mobile viewport assertions for:

- campaign pages and secondary public controls
- cart / checkout drawers on small phone sizes
- Manage Pledge and Update Card reachability on short mobile viewports
- no-horizontal-overflow checks on the main public and pledge-management paths

Recent public-page coverage also now protects more localized campaign chrome, including:

- hero video play/loading states
- supporter-community teaser copy
- diary tab labels and empty states
- production-phase labels and CTA copy
- gallery accessibility labels

The content-safety filter suite in `tests/unit/content-safety-filter.test.ts` also falls back to Podman when host Bundler/Jekyll gems are unavailable. On macOS, it can start the Podman machine as part of that fallback.

The current Podman scope is intentionally narrow:

- included: Jekyll, Worker, local `worker/.dev.vars`, local Wrangler state, optional host Stripe CLI forwarding, Podman-aware `test-checkout.sh`, `test-e2e.sh`, `test-worker.sh`, `smoke-pledge-management.sh`, `pledge-report.sh`, and `fulfillment-report.sh`
- included too: containerized headless Playwright for the automated browser suite
- not yet included: a containerized interactive manual checkout browser step

Use [docs/PODMAN.md](/docs/operations/podman-local-dev/) for the exact setup and current limitations.

If you change `pricing.sales_tax_rate` or `pricing.flat_shipping_rate` in the Jekyll config, the repo now auto-syncs the mirrored Worker values in [worker/wrangler.toml](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/wrangler.toml) through the main dev/test paths. Restart `./scripts/dev.sh --podman` before testing checkout math so both services pick up the new values.

If you tune free-plan read behavior, keep these in sync too:

- `cache.live_stats_ttl_seconds`
- `cache.live_inventory_ttl_seconds`

After changing either cache TTL locally, restart `./scripts/dev.sh --podman` and rerun:

```bash
npx vitest run tests/unit/live-stats.test.ts tests/unit/manage-page.test.ts tests/unit/config-boot.test.ts
```

Those suites protect the combined `/live/:slug` read path, the browser cache behavior, and the config boot wiring that forks rely on.

On GitHub, the same gate runs automatically in the `Merge Smoke` workflow for pull requests targeting `main`.

The merge gate now writes one log file per phase and prints a final PASS/FAIL summary with log paths. If a late Podman-backed phase fails, start with the log directory printed at the end of the run instead of scrolling through the whole transcript.

### Secret Audit

Run this before pushing when local secrets have changed, or let `npm run test:premerge` run it automatically:

```bash
npm run test:secrets
```

The audit checks:

- `worker/.dev.vars` remains gitignored and untracked
- non-allowlisted secret values from local env files do not appear in tracked or untracked repo files
- those values do not appear in git history

CI remains safe when `worker/.dev.vars` does not exist; in that case the audit still verifies ignore rules and skips the local value scan.

### Main Branch Comparison

Run the same automated gate on `main` in a clean worktree so the baseline and the patch branch are directly comparable. If `main` predates `test:premerge`, run the equivalent syntax, unit, security, and E2E commands manually there.

```bash
git worktree add ../pool-main-check main
ln -s "$(pwd)/node_modules" ../pool-main-check/node_modules
cd ../pool-main-check
npm run test:premerge
```

If you create the temporary worktree, remove it after comparison:

```bash
cd -
git worktree remove ../pool-main-check
```

### Manual Smoke Checklist

Run these against staging before merge when a staging environment exists. If no staging environment exists for The Pool, run the same checklist locally with `./scripts/dev.sh --podman` and record that exception in the PR/release notes.

1. Start a new checkout on a live test campaign and confirm `/checkout-intent/start` returns a custom-session bootstrap in custom mode, or a hosted URL in hosted fallback mode.
2. Complete a pledge and verify the webhook stores the pledge, stats update, and confirmation email path stays healthy.
3. Modify a pledge with tier/support/custom amount changes and verify totals, history, and inventory update correctly.
4. Cancel an uncharged pledge and verify stats and inventory are released correctly.
5. Run settlement dry-run and live-run on seeded pledges, confirming campaigns only mark settled when nothing needs attention.
6. Trigger diary, announcement, and milestone broadcasts on a campaign large enough to cross pagination boundaries.
7. Trigger a fulfillment report on a campaign with both campaign and platform items, confirming that runner recipients receive only campaign rows and `support_email` receives the platform-only attachment.

For checkout or Worker business-logic changes, a smoke pass is still required before merge:

- Prefer staging when available.
- If no staging exists, use the stronger local path:
  - `./scripts/dev.sh --podman`
  - `./scripts/smoke-pledge-management.sh`
  - the operator checklist in [docs/MERGE_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md](/docs/operations/merge-smoke-checklist/)
  - a PR note explicitly stating that no staging environment exists

For an operator-ready version with exact commands and expected results, use [docs/MERGE_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md](/docs/operations/merge-smoke-checklist/).

For local rehearsal of pledge management, prefer the `smoke-editable` campaign. It is local-only via `test_only: true`, stays live well past the normal smoke window, and gives `/test/setup` a stable target for modify/cancel coverage.

You can exercise that path end to end with:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-pledge-management.sh
```

When `ADMIN_SECRET` is available, that smoke path now also verifies that the campaign remains projection-clean after setup, modify, and cancel by calling the read-only `POST /stats/:slug/check` endpoint between mutation phases.

For local CSV verification against your actual local Worker state, use:

```bash
./scripts/pledge-report.sh --local
./scripts/fulfillment-report.sh --local
```

Use `pledge-report.sh` when you want the full ledger, including modify/cancel deltas and tip-change annotations. Use `fulfillment-report.sh` when you want the merged current state for a backer within a campaign.

If the merged fulfillment view and the public site ever disagree for a campaign, treat that as a likely stale stats/inventory projection issue first, not a reporting bug by default. The admin stats and inventory recalc endpoints now repair stale `campaign-pledges:{slug}` indexes while rebuilding the campaign projection state.

Before you repair a projection, you can now check for drift explicitly:

```bash
./scripts/check-projections.sh                 # Check all campaigns
./scripts/check-projections.sh hand-relations  # Check one campaign
./scripts/check-projections.sh --podman        # Reuse/start the Podman dev stack first
```

That script calls the read-only admin drift-check endpoints and exits nonzero when stored `campaign-pledges:{slug}`, `stats:{slug}`, or `tier-inventory:{slug}` projections no longer match active pledge truth.

### Intentional Behavior Changes

When reviewing results, do not flag these as regressions:

- Magic links are now order-scoped instead of email-scoped.
- `/checkout-intent/start` now reserves scarce limited inventory before payment confirmation, and successful persistence confirms that reservation.
- Legacy `GET /checkout` is intentionally disabled.

### Adding Tests

Create files in `tests/unit/` with `.test.ts` extension:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('myFunction', () => {
  it('does something', () => {
    expect(myFunction()).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

```

---

## Security Tests (Vitest)

Penetration tests for the Worker API. Located in `tests/security/`.

### Coverage

| Category | Tests |
|----------|-------|
| Auth Bypass | Dev-token bypass, token validation, expiry, tampering |
| Webhook Security | Stripe signature verification, duplicate-event handling, shipping address injection, removed legacy webhook handling |
| Authorization | Admin endpoints, cross-user access, test endpoint guards |

# Start local Worker first
cd worker && wrangler dev

# In another terminal:
npm run test:security                # Against localhost:8787

# Against staging, if you maintain one:
npm run test:security:staging

# Against production (read-only tests):
WORKER_URL=https://worker.example.com PROD_MODE=true npm run test:security
```

### Prerequisites

- Worker running locally (`wrangler dev`) or accessible staging/prod URL
- For full test coverage, set environment variables:
  - `WORKER_URL` — Base URL (default: `http://localhost:8787`)
  - `PROD_MODE` — Skip destructive tests (default: `false`)
  - `ADMIN_SECRET` — For admin auth tests
  - `TEST_TOKEN` — Valid magic link token

See [tests/security/README.md](/docs/operations/security-test-suite/) for details.

---

## Manual Testing Prerequisites

- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) for webhook testing
- Stripe account (test mode)
- Resend account (free tier: 3,000 emails/month)

---

## 1. Cloudflare Worker Setup

### Create KV Namespaces

```bash
wrangler login
wrangler kv:namespace create "VOTES"
wrangler kv:namespace create "VOTES" --preview
wrangler kv:namespace create "PLEDGES"
wrangler kv:namespace create "PLEDGES" --preview
```

### Set Secrets

```bash
cd worker
openssl rand -base64 32

wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
wrangler secret put MAGIC_LINK_SECRET
wrangler secret put CHECKOUT_INTENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET
```

### Run Worker Locally

Preferred:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh --podman
```

Manual fallback:

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler dev --env dev --port 8787
```

## 2. Resend Setup

### Create Account & API Key

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Go to **API Keys** → **Create API Key**
3. Name: "Project Dev"
4. Permission: "Sending access"
5. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### Verify Domain (for production)

1. Go to **Domains** → **Add Domain**
2. Add your verified sending domain
3. Add the DNS records Resend provides
4. Wait for verification

### Test Mode (no domain needed)

For testing, you can send to your own email without domain verification:
- Resend allows sending from `onboarding@resend.dev` in test mode
- Or use your verified personal email

### Test Email Sending

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/emails' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer re_YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "onboarding@resend.dev",
    "to": "your-email@example.com",
    "subject": "Test from your deployment",
    "html": "<p>Magic link test!</p>"
  }'
```

---

## 3. Stripe Setup (Test Mode)

### Get Test Keys

1. Login to [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Toggle to **Test mode** (top right)
3. Go to **Developers** → **API keys**
4. Copy **Secret key** (`sk_test_...`)

### Install Stripe CLI

```bash
# macOS
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login
stripe login
```

### Forward Webhooks to Local Worker

Preferred option for local end-to-end testing:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh --podman
```

This starts Jekyll, the Worker, Stripe CLI forwarding, and writes the matching `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` into `worker/.dev.vars`.
It also clears stale processes on ports `4000`, `8787`, and `4040` so the local stack matches the automated smoke/test harness.

Manual fallback:

```bash
# Forward Stripe webhooks to your local Worker
stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8787/webhooks/stripe
# Note the webhook signing secret it outputs (whsec_...)
```

Add the webhook secret to your local Worker config:
```bash
printf '\nSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...\n' >> worker/.dev.vars
# Or edit worker/.dev.vars and replace the existing STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET value
```

---

## 4. Full End-to-End Test

### Start All Services

Preferred:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh --podman
```

Manual fallback:

Terminal 1 - Jekyll:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.local.yml --port 4000
# Site at http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

Terminal 2 - Worker:
```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler dev --env dev --port 8787
# Worker at http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Terminal 3 - Stripe CLI:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8787/webhooks/stripe
```

### Test the Flow

1. **Add to cart**: Go to http://127.0.0.1:4000/campaigns/hand-relations/
   - Click "Pledge $5" on a tier
   - Cart opens with item

2. **Checkout**: Click "Continue to Pledge" in the first-party cart review
   - Verify the review shows subtotal + tip + tax + shipping immediately
   - Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future expiry, any CVC

3. **Stripe Setup**: The second checkout sidecar keeps you on-site and mounts Stripe's secure payment UI
   - Card is saved (not charged)
   - The client waits for pledge persistence confirmation before treating the flow as successful
   - You are then sent to the success page

4. **Check email**: You should receive the supporter email(s) with magic links

5. **Test community access**:
   - Click the community link in the email
   - Or use: http://127.0.0.1:4000/community/hand-relations/?dev=1

6. **Test voting**:
   - Vote on a decision
   - Refresh page - your vote should persist

### Stripe Test Cards

| Card Number | Scenario |
|-------------|----------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Successful save/setup |
| `4000 0000 0000 3220` | 3D Secure required |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | Declined (insufficient funds) |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Declined (generic) |

---

## 5. Testing Individual Components

### Test Magic Link Token

```js
// In browser console on any page with the Worker running
const token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';
fetch(`http://localhost:8787/pledge?token=${token}`)
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

### Test Vote API

```bash
# Get vote status
curl "http://localhost:8787/votes?token=YOUR_TOKEN&decisions=poster,festival"

# Cast vote
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/votes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"YOUR_TOKEN","decisionId":"poster","option":"A"}'
```

### Test KV Locally

```bash
# List keys
wrangler kv:key list --binding VOTES --preview

# Get a value
wrangler kv:key get "results:hand-relations:poster" --binding VOTES --preview
```

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Checkout start fails closed
- Verify `CHECKOUT_INTENT_SECRET` exists in `worker/.dev.vars`
- Confirm the cart payload uses valid first-party item IDs like `{campaignSlug}__{tierId}`

### Webhook not received
- Check Stripe CLI is running and forwarding
- Check Worker logs: `wrangler tail`
- Verify webhook secret is set

### Email not sent
- Check Resend dashboard for errors
- Verify API key is correct
- Check "from" address is verified or use `onboarding@resend.dev`

### Community page shows "Access Denied"
- Use `?dev=1` for local testing without Worker
- Check session storage key: `supporter_token_hand-relations`

### Votes not persisting
- Check KV binding in wrangler.toml
- Use `--preview` namespace for local dev
- Check Worker logs for errors

---

## 7. Testing Worker Enhancements

### Test Campaign Validation

1. **Build Jekyll to generate campaigns.json:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll build
   cat _site/api/campaigns.json  # Verify it exists
   ```

2. **Test malformed first-party checkout start:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/checkout-intent/start \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"campaignSlug":"hand-relations","items":[{"id":"bad-item","quantity":1}],"email":"test@example.com"}'
   ```
   Expected: Returns a fail-closed validation error such as `Invalid cart item id`

### Test Stripe Webhook Signature Verification

1. **Ensure Stripe CLI is forwarding webhooks:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev.sh --podman
   # Or, manually: stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8787/webhooks/stripe
   ```

2. **Set the webhook secret:**
   ```bash
   # scripts/dev.sh --podman does this automatically for worker/.dev.vars
   # Manual setup only if you are not using the main Podman dev script
   ```

3. **Trigger a test webhook:**
   ```bash
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   ```
   Check Worker logs for "Pledge confirmed" message.

4. **Test invalid signature (should fail):**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/webhooks/stripe \
     -H "stripe-signature: invalid" \
     -d '{"type":"test"}'
   ```
   Expected: `{"error":"Invalid signature"}`

### Test Stored Pledge Metadata

After completing a pledge flow:

1. **Check Worker-backed pledge data** through `/pledge?token=...`
2. **Verify data contains:**
   - `stripeCustomerId`
   - `stripePaymentMethodId`
   - `pledgeStatus: "active"`
   - `charged: false`

### Test Pledge Management Endpoints

1. **Get pledge details (requires valid token):**
   ```bash
   # Use token from supporter email
   curl "http://localhost:8787/pledge?token=YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```
   Expected: Returns order details with `canModify`, `canCancel` flags.

2. **Cancel pledge:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/pledge/cancel \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"token":"YOUR_TOKEN"}'
   ```
   Expected: `{"success":true,"message":"Pledge cancelled"}`

3. **Verify cancellation:**
   - Check the pledge now reports `pledgeStatus: "cancelled"`
   - Retry cancel: should get a clean error response

### Test Update Payment Method

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/pledge/payment-method/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"YOUR_TOKEN"}'
```
Expected: Returns a custom-session bootstrap for on-site `Update Card`, or a hosted URL in fallback mode.

### Test Live Stats Endpoint

1. **Get live stats for a campaign:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8787/stats/hand-relations
   ```
   Expected: Returns `{ pledgedAmount, pledgeCount, tierCounts, goalAmount, ... }`

2. **Verify stats update after pledge:**
   - Make a test pledge
   - Call stats endpoint again
   - Confirm `pledgedAmount` increased

3. **Recalculate stats (admin):**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/stats/hand-relations/recalculate \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET"
   ```

### Test Admin Rebuild Trigger

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/admin/rebuild \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason":"test-rebuild"}'
```
Expected: Returns `{ success: true }` and triggers GitHub workflow.

## 8. Production Checklist

- [ ] Switch Stripe to live keys
- [ ] Verify your sending domain in Resend
- [ ] Deploy Worker: `wrangler deploy`
- [ ] Set up Stripe webhook in dashboard → `https://worker.example.com/webhooks/stripe`
- [ ] Test with a real $1 pledge

## 9. Secrets Reference

### GitHub Actions (Repo → Settings → Secrets)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — Stripe live secret (sk_...)
- `CHECKOUT_INTENT_SECRET` — HMAC secret for checkout intent signing
- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` auto-provided for commits

### Cloudflare Worker (wrangler or dashboard → Variables)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — same as above
- `SITE_BASE` — `https://site.example.com`
- `WORKER_BASE` — `https://worker.example.com`
- `APP_MODE` — `live` or `test`
- `CHECKOUT_INTENT_SECRET` — Random 32+ char string for checkout signing
- `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET` — Random 32+ char string for HMAC token signing
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — Resend API key for supporter emails (re_...)
- `ADMIN_SECRET` — Random string for admin API endpoints
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — (optional) GitHub PAT with `workflow` scope for rebuild triggers

### Cloudflare KV
- **Namespace**: `PLEDGES` — Stores pledge data and aggregated stats
  - Keys: `pledge:{orderId}` → pledge JSON
  - Keys: `email:{email}` → array of order IDs
  - Keys: `stats:{campaignSlug}` → `{ pledgedAmount, pledgeCount, tierCounts }`
- **Namespace**: `VOTES` — Stores community votes
  - Keys: `vote:{campaignSlug}:{decisionId}:{orderId}` → option string
  - Keys: `results:{campaignSlug}:{decisionId}` → JSON `{optionA: count, ...}`

### Stripe Dashboard
- Webhook endpoint = `https://worker.example.com/webhooks/stripe`
  - Events: `checkout.session.completed`
- Product catalog not required; amounts come from Worker-canonicalized first-party cart items

### Resend Dashboard
- **Domain**: Verify your sending domain for the configured transactional sender
- **API Key**: Create key with "Sending access" permission
- Used for: All supporter-facing pledge email (confirmation, manage/community access, diary updates, announcements, charge success, payment failure, cancellations)
- Local dev note: even when `SITE_BASE` points at `127.0.0.1`, embedded email images still use the public `https://site.example.com` asset base so inbox previews do not show broken localhost image URLs.
