# Changelog

## Last Updated

September 6, 2026

## Unreleased

### Dependency maintenance

- Added explicit root and Worker production/full audit checks to Merge Smoke,
  separate from installation and tests. Transient npm failures have bounded
  retries; missing evidence fails the check instead of appearing clean.
- Updated Vitest and its V8 coverage provider to 4.1.11, Vite to 8.2.2, and
  axe-core to 4.13.0.
- Kept shared build/release tooling on Platform's reviewed esbuild 0.28.1 and
  smol-toml 1.7.1, made the root requirements exact, and added regression coverage
  for manifest/lockfile alignment and version-only Dependabot exclusions.

### Production posture

- Disabled Cloudflare Worker preview URLs explicitly and made missing or enabled
  preview URLs a production-posture failure.

### Documentation

- Updated English and Spanish About and Terms pages to match saved add-on
  pricing, cancellation deadlines, immediate failed-payment retries after a
  card update, campaign email preferences, and pledge/email independence.
  The copy review covers payment expectations, privacy, access, and messaging;
  existing fulfillment remedies and statutory-rights protections remain intact.
- Added a task-based documentation index and consolidated the overview,
  workflow, and developer-note guides into architecture, campaign content,
  and Worker API references. Setup, deployment, reporting, and verification
  procedures now live with their owning guides; root and Worker READMEs are
  concise entry points.
- Corrected stale Worker deployment, provider-tax, and report-accounting
  descriptions while retaining current-state, roadmap, and release-history
  boundaries.
- Excluded maintainer documentation from the public Jekyll artifact and added
  a pre-merge artifact check, preserving the root and localized website pages.
- Separated current behavior, prospective work, and release history across the
  README, practice guides, roadmap, changelog, and release evidence.
- Removed dated provider snapshots, completed-work roadmaps, release-specific
  status ledgers, and duplicate future-work lists from current-state guides.
- Moved the tax calculator guide into Pool so provider behavior, configuration,
  troubleshooting, and verification have one upstream documentation source.

### Local verification

- Preserved the caller's Ruby/Bundler and Node selection across pre-merge host
  phases. Login shells could previously pass dependency checks under rbenv,
  then switch to macOS system Ruby for the build and unnecessarily fall back
  to Podman. Added regression coverage for host and Podman build dispatch.

## v1.2.20 - 2026-08-06

### Reusable product-video workflow

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.32.0`
  (`85165a16ac6923b438514bdce0a9957c1804db5f`) and adopted
  Product Video Core `0.1.0`.
- Replaced the stale local-only worktree engine with a thin Pool adapter that
  retains Jekyll preview startup, the `smoke-editable` fixture/selectors,
  capture presentation CSS, editorial timing, optional marketing destination,
  generated media, and publication authority.
- Added production-length capture/render commands plus a short real-interface
  smoke flow, consumer characterization, syntax coverage, and clean-checkout
  `_config.test.yml` startup.

### Security, performance, and rollback

- Capture stays loopback-only from Pool, same-origin, and declarative; output
  is confined below `tmp/product-video`, existing runs are preserved, and no
  recursive caller-selected cleanup remains. FFmpeg/FFprobe run without a
  shell and capture fails when effective frame rate misses its configured
  floor. Every completed render must also decode an alpha plane before its
  FFprobe evidence can report success.
- Capture CSS is injected only into the local Playwright frame and is not
  linked from production templates, so the feature adds no production request
  or browser runtime. Jekyll and the release gate exclude and reject the
  complete generated `tmp` tree so local frames, renders, and nested previews
  cannot enter a Pages artifact. Pool can roll back the exact Platform gitlink and local
  adapter independently without affecting Store, Podcast, or Dust Wave.
- Playwright web-server startup now preserves the caller-selected rbenv and
  Node 24 toolchain instead of opening a login shell that could fall back to
  macOS system Ruby before any browser test ran.
- Default all-format rendering is covered on macOS Bash 3.2 as well as modern
  shells; strict-mode empty format lists no longer abort before FFmpeg starts.

## v1.2.19 - 2026-08-06

### Separately versioned Jekyll golden-project contract

- Pinned `dust-wave-jekyll-template` `v0.1.0`
  (`351281a5aec60fa85653a3d23391e66fb860aae6`) as an independent source-upgrade
  submodule alongside Platform v0.31.0.
- Bound 15 exact Liquid includes and two exact Ruby plugins to one manifest,
  digest, and explicit check/write CLI while preserving Pool's byte-identical
  checked-in runtime copies.
- Added pin, version, digest, drift-command, and generated-output exclusion
  regressions. The complete release gate now fails before build on template
  drift and fails after build if the source-upgrade submodule is published.
- The template adds no browser request, deployed byte, route, Worker code, or
  credential. Pool retains routes, data, localization, content, configuration,
  tests, deployment authority, and independent one-commit rollback.

### Post-release maintenance and documentation

- Stabilized the dashboard readiness budget so it measures the cold-navigation
  application request chain through the first summary/settings requests while
  retaining visible-dashboard, tab-switch, and supporter-table assertions;
  host-side assertion polling no longer creates a false performance failure.
- Split cold Podman Worker dependency installation from runtime readiness: a
  bounded, lock-hash-verified install grace period prevents slow `npm ci`
  downloads from being killed and restarted by the existing 60-second Worker
  health budget, while warm volumes continue immediately.
- Made the static `POOL_CONFIG` browser contract wait for DOM readiness rather
  than unrelated full-page resource completion, eliminating the only flaky
  result in the complete 113-test browser gate without weakening its config
  assertions.
- Bounded pre-merge Worker/Jekyll process-tree cleanup and added a stubborn
  child regression, preventing a fully passing hosted gate from remaining
  alive until the workflow timeout because a server ignored termination.
- Reconciled the root, Worker, testing, developer, performance, dashboard,
  i18n, roadmap, and English/Spanish creator-checklist documentation with the
  active Platform `v0.31.0`, Jekyll Template `v0.1.0`, Pool `v1.2.19`, Node 24,
  and Wrangler 4.118 contracts without changing creator or deployment
  authority.

## v1.2.18 - 2026-08-06

### Allowlisted shared-browser asset minification

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.31.0`
  (`5ca8ee6d0ff8912ccfdc27c8459a5ef72f8c0579`) and adopted Build Core `0.2.0`.
- Extended the generated-asset build step to minify only `_site/assets` and the
  generated copies of the pinned Site Shell sources through explicit,
  traversal-safe roots.
- Added consumer characterization for root selection, untouched Worker source,
  multi-root output, and the exact write/check commands used by local and Pages
  builds.
- The six generated Site Shell scripts fall from 15,573 to 9,531 bytes, saving
  6,042 raw bytes (38.8%); post-write check mode reports zero further savings
  across all 32 selected generated assets.
- This changes no route, request count, global identity, checkout behavior, or
  source asset. Pool retains budgets, orchestration, deployment authority, and
  independent one-commit rollback.

## v1.2.17 - 2026-08-06

### Policy-injected shared design foundations

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.30.0`
  (`499e6c1994d79be6049ef204fefd728f22b8093e`) and adopted Design Core `0.2.0`.
- Removed Pool's local form, layout, and mixin partials. Pool now injects its
  padding-based centered gutter plus brand-title spacing, animation identity,
  mobile type scale, and line width before importing neutral shared Sass.
- Characterized generated output before and after migration: `main.css`
  remained `d3568877d0f31903ccf02a7b37c82220115146609141457a5ae84969c123ea95`
  and `admin.css` remained
  `a398fef8d7d257092f1685dab132e9d98a87bbadba347a90a62fd5c081445e84`
  byte-for-byte.
- Added pin and compile-time policy regressions. The extraction adds no browser
  request or runtime code; Pool retains tokens, import order, templates,
  content, CSS budgets, deployment, and independent rollback.

## v1.2.16 - 2026-08-06

### Shared Site Shell browser primitives

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.29.0`
  (`7ed3d9b0220b88126235a3b7edfd507f8846f56d`) and adopted Site Shell `0.2.0`.
- Removed Pool's duplicate cart-icon, deferred-stylesheet, form-control identity,
  and shipping-option browser implementations. Thin Liquid policy includes keep
  Pool's cache key, provider and event names, accessible labels, control-ID
  prefix and dataset priority local.
- Preserved lazy cart loading and versioned shared URLs, so the extraction adds
  no eager cart-runtime requests and keeps independent submodule rollback.
- Added consumer characterization for shipping choices, cart totals and labels,
  dynamically inserted controls, stylesheet deferral, runtime loading, exact
  package versions, every consumed shared source path, and explicit size budgets
  for each deployed Site Shell browser primitive.
- Stabilized the admin readiness budget around DOM and application readiness so
  unrelated post-DOM third-party font or media latency cannot mask regressions
  in Pool's own dashboard initialization path.

## v1.2.15 - 2026-08-06

### Shared release-evidence runtime

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.28.0`
  (`5836ced5129ce3eddb09a035601de23ec58a5737`) and adopted Release Core `0.2.0`.
- Replaced Pool's duplicate cache-policy audit, Cloudflare admin response-rule
  client, and assisted screen-reader evidence implementation with thin,
  import-safe policy adapters.
- Release Core now bounds origins, paths, rule metadata, command inputs, and
  diagnostic output; rejects redirects; avoids shell command interpolation;
  and excludes credentials, customer data, and response bodies from evidence.
  Pool retains its production targets, route policy, expected phrases,
  provider credentials, release decisions, deployment, and independent
  one-commit rollback.
- Added consumer adapter regressions for Pool-owned origins and policy plus the
  existing Cloudflare, cache, performance, pin, and release-version coverage.

## v1.2.14 - 2026-08-06

### Shared compile-time design components

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.27.0`
  (`06a9453ed2f310f5acca1a1f864fdce4a45d5f56`) and adopted Design Core `0.1.0`.
- Removed five byte-identical local Sass partials and resolved their base,
  button, content-block, modal, and utility components from the pinned Platform
  load path with byte-equivalent generated CSS.
- The package adds no browser JavaScript or request-time cost. Pool retains
  tokens, mixins, import order, templates, focus and responsive policy,
  content, CSS budgets, Jekyll integration, deployment, and rollback. Liquid
  includes and Ruby plugins remain local by explicit architecture decision.

## v1.2.13 - 2026-08-06

### Shared test setup and mobile viewport helper

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.26.0`
  (`3063aae3cb1cf80e2f8bc5f9b1e40c814dff47b2`) and adopted Test Core `0.1.0`.
- Replaced the exact duplicate browser Storage setup and horizontal-overflow
  helper with tiny Vitest and Playwright adapters; Platform gains no runner or
  browser-automation dependency.
- Pool retains fixtures, URLs, viewports, responsive/product expectations, CI,
  deployment, and rollback. The independent accessibility and media contract
  tests remain local, and Playwright test discovery covers 113 cases.

## v1.2.12 - 2026-08-06

### Shared durable-outbox mechanics

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.25.0`
  (`4f1c7c042456da1a86116c24c7d346dfaddb21b4`) and Worker Core `0.12.0`.
- Replaced duplicate canonical job IDs, bounded record/queue creation,
  due/lease/expiry classification, retry delay, redacted error evidence,
  email/tag normalization, and Resend event mechanics with shared primitives.
- Pool retains KV operations, template rendering, global/campaign suppression,
  provider sends and scheduling, pledge effects, credentials, deployment, and
  independent rollback. Existing frozen-payload and idempotency tests pass.

## v1.2.11 - 2026-08-06

### Shared bounded tax-provider transport

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.24.0`
  (`16ccc75209f1b07044299a60c0ff26520fe70607`) and Tax Core `0.3.0`.
- Replaced Pool's duplicate Zip-Tax and New Mexico GRT fetch, address-build,
  street-parse, and source-normalization code with shared bounded transport.
- Provider URLs require HTTPS, redirects are rejected, timeouts abort, and
  request/response data is bounded without returning credentials or raw
  network errors. Pool retains provider/fallback selection, campaign
  taxability, quote calculation, checkout effects, deployment, and rollback.

## v1.2.10 - 2026-08-06

### Shared bounded GitHub transport

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.23.0`
  (`a0006c3e0c3f8ab814387491753989956adbbe94`) and Worker Core `0.11.0`.
- Replaced Pool's duplicate workflow dispatch and Contents API client with a
  thin adapter while preserving rebuild, media-optimization, campaign-archive,
  file publication, directory-list, and idempotent delete behavior.
- Requests now reject redirects, time out, bound paths, refs, workflow inputs,
  content, and provider responses, and return normalized errors without raw
  network exceptions or credentials. Pool retains repository defaults,
  content and workflow policy, logging, authorization, effects, deployment,
  and independent rollback.

## v1.2.9 - 2026-08-06

### Shared USPS transport and country registry

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.22.0`
  (`514c00932d5fb2fa05ee6f7cebb7ea44d9426d78`) and Shipping Core `0.2.0`.
- Replaced Pool's duplicate USPS OAuth, rate-search, timeout, token/quote cache,
  and provider-cooldown implementation with a thin configuration adapter.
- Made Platform's 95-country YAML the canonical source and added explicit
  check/write sync commands plus a byte-equality pin regression for Pool's
  Jekyll snapshot.
- Provider credentials remain request-only; mail-class/token/cache state is
  bounded; timeout, 401 refresh, 429/5xx cooldown, fallback, and full shipping
  behavior remain covered. Pool retains address eligibility, campaign rates,
  checkout/fulfillment effects, storage, routes, deployment, and rollback.

## v1.2.8 - 2026-08-06

### Shared inventory state mechanics

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.21.0`
  (`98533957456eed4bb2eae6f474b9072a419b64bc`), adopted
  `@dustwave/inventory-core` `0.1.0`, and Worker Core `0.10.0`.
- Replaced Pool's duplicate count-map, snapshot-cloning, reservation expiry,
  and reserved-count helpers with shared pure mechanics while preserving the
  stored campaign snapshot as authoritative over later bootstrap input.
- Added an independent pre-move regression for Pool's bootstrap policy. The
  full coordinator contract continues to cover atomic selection changes,
  competing claims, reservation confirmation/release, expiry cleanup, and
  legacy inventory migration.
- Pool retains all Durable Object transactions, KV writes, campaign/tier
  labels, checkout and pledge transitions, TTL selection, routes, deployment,
  and independent rollback.

## v1.2.7 - 2026-08-06

### Shared logging and media-catalog mechanics

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.19.0`
  (`1bfbdd403fc9efafb8d261dd846cedb9d52ed444`), Worker Core `0.9.0`, and
  Media Core `0.4.0`.
- Replaced Pool's duplicate scoped-console implementation and site-media
  catalog mechanics with thin campaign-policy adapters while preserving the
  existing product/runtime prefixes, severity policy, manifest shape,
  placement budgets, derivative paths, and public media behavior.
- Added independent media characterization before migration and fail-closed
  traversal coverage. Shared labels, scopes, error fields, media paths, and
  known-path sets are now bounded.
- Pool retains environment/config parsing, logging policy and destinations,
  campaign/default scope and slug policy, content, filesystem access,
  transforms, admin routes, storage, deployment, and rollback.

## v1.2.6 - 2026-08-06

### Shared deterministic shipping mechanics

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.18.0`
  (`3b8bdacc224bda625103718ba0fa8489517ff993`) and adopted
  `@dustwave/shipping-core` `0.1.0`.
- Replaced 542 lines of duplicate item-profile, mixed-shipment aggregation,
  missing-metadata, fallback/free/manual quote, and shipping-option mechanics
  with thin campaign-policy adapters.
- Added an independent pre-move consumer contract for mixed tier,
  support-item, and add-on shipments plus option fallback behavior.
- Bounded selection, catalog, mail-class, and option arrays before shared
  loops while preserving the current USPS First-Class flat table and normal
  quote results.
- Pool retains campaign fallback/free/configured-option policy, destination
  validation, USPS credentials and transport, OAuth/cache/backoff/retry,
  checkout, fulfillment, storage, deployment, and rollback.

## v1.2.5 - 2026-08-06

### Shared session security mechanics

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.17.0`
  (`3a526defd21d692292c73652966a044167f881d7`) and Worker Core `0.8.0`.
- Replaced Pool's characterized login-token encoding/verification,
  session-cookie serialization/clearing, and same-origin request checks with
  bounded shared primitives through thin Pool policy adapters.
- Preserved the exact secure admin cookie, current missing-origin-header and
  local unconfigured-origin behavior, 15-minute login TTL, eight-hour session
  TTL, one-time nonce consumption, fixed session expiry, and independent
  rollback.
- Added rejection coverage for extra token segments and retained the existing
  replay, expiry, CSRF, cross-origin, role/scope, and no-durable-write failure
  contracts.
- Pool continues to own secret selection, login/session records, campaign
  authorization, CSRF tokens and header names, routes, storage, email,
  credentials, deployment, and rollback.

## v1.2.4 - 2026-08-06

### Shared Resend security and retry mechanics

- Advanced the immutable Platform pin to `v0.16.0`
  (`d075c3e1a29134d3ba6e4631b76dc63212347d14`) and Worker Core `0.7.0`.
- Replaced Pool's characterized Resend/Svix HMAC verification copy with the
  bounded shared raw-body verifier, retaining Pool's existing response adapter
  and all event parsing, journal, delivery, and suppression effects locally.
- Replaced Pool's duplicate Resend error class and retryable/ambiguous status
  rules with shared pure mechanics. Pool still decides attempt budgets,
  idempotency windows, backoff scheduling, terminal evidence, and whether any
  retry occurs.
- Added pre-migration coverage for multiple signature candidates, stale events,
  malformed secrets, body mismatches, 429 retry timing, and permanent-bounce
  suppression. Oversized event IDs and fractional timestamps now fail closed.

## v1.2.3 - 2026-08-06

### Shared cryptographic primitives

- Replaced Pool's characterized SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-256, high-entropy token,
  cookie parsing, email normalization, and constant-work string-comparison
  copies with the immutable `@dustwave/worker-core` `0.6.0` implementation
  already pinned by Pool through Platform `v0.15.0`.
- Kept authentication policy, login-token shape, session and CSRF records,
  permissions, routes, KV storage, credentials, release, and rollback in Pool;
  the local HMAC adapter preserves Pool's existing argument order.
- Raised the obsolete no-`randomUUID` login-history fallback from 8 to 16
  random bytes so it satisfies Platform's token-entropy contract without
  changing the normal Workers runtime path.
- Added consumer contract coverage for the exact digest, URL-safe signature
  and token shapes, encoded cookies, normalized email, constant-work equality,
  and rejection of undersized tokens, alongside the existing login replay,
  session, CSRF, and redacted-history suites.

## v1.2.2 - 2026-08-06

### Shared Platform consolidation

- Advanced the exact `dust-wave-platform` gitlink to immutable `v0.15.0`
  (`2e79a8d70cb6d30805ea141e53d32f9387441756`), including
  `@dustwave/worker-core` `0.6.0` and `@dustwave/release-core` `0.1.0`.
- Replaced Pool's characterized Worker CORS/security response, timezone/date,
  and Stripe transport copies with thin Pool policy adapters. Pool keeps its
  private origin, campaign aliases, Stripe API version and provider identity,
  payment rules, persistence, and deployment authority.
- Replaced exact Wrangler inventory, KV backup transformation, checksum,
  command-result, and provider-evidence copies with pinned Platform primitives;
  Pool continues to own every command, credential, provider call, environment
  ID, release gate, rollout, and rollback.
- Expanded consumer tests for private-origin fallback, full JSON security
  headers, daylight-saving boundaries, Stripe provider identity, missing
  credentials/object IDs, and the exact Platform package/source pin.
- Avoided constructing a Stripe client during reconciliation when the indexed
  pledge batch contains no provider objects, preserving the local-only missing
  PaymentIntent evidence path and eliminating unnecessary provider setup.

## v1.2.1 - 2026-08-06

Release preparation:

- Migrated the byte-identical header navigation, live announcements, Worker
  timezone primitives, New Mexico GRT starter snapshot, updater, and generated
  asset minifier to immutable `dust-wave-platform` `v0.12.0` packages.
- Removed Pool's duplicate source copies while retaining its templates,
  localization, scheduling, tax-provider policy, campaign/pledge data, build
  orchestration, credentials, and independent deployment authority.
- Preserved the existing consumer characterization suites and added the new
  shared paths and exact package versions to the executable Platform pin gate.

- Advanced the exact `dust-wave-platform` gitlink through workspace `0.12.0`,
  including `@dustwave/admin-shell` `0.10.2`, `@dustwave/build-core` `0.1.0`,
  `@dustwave/site-shell` `0.1.0`, `@dustwave/tax-core` `0.2.0`, and
  `@dustwave/worker-core` `0.4.0`, while keeping campaign, pledge, payment,
  storage, and deployment authority within Pool.
- Added an executable consumer contract for the immutable gitlink, canonical
  submodule remote, package versions, and every raw shared module Pool serves
  or imports.
- Enabled safe local-identifier minification in generated JavaScript while
  preserving browser globals and the existing production asset budgets.
- Made the Podman release wrappers clean-checkout safe on macOS by using a
  portable Playwright image lookup and an ephemeral local Jekyll test config.
- Replaced single-sample Lighthouse decisions with the median of three runs,
  preventing one noisy sample from falsely failing or approving a release.
- Promoted the mutable-pledge fixture inventory check from a warning to a hard
  release gate, aligned its unit campaign fixture with the built campaign, and
  normalized both inventory endpoint response shapes before asserting counts.
- Made deployment setup dry-runs non-interactive around secret planning, so
  provider values are neither requested nor passed to a CLI during rehearsal.
- Pinned patched transitive `undici` and `ip-address` releases for local test
  and deployment tooling, clearing both production and full npm audits.
- Hardened legacy admin-secret comparison to fixed bounded work and replaced a
  one-request timing check with alternating median samples on isolated IPs.
- Preserved the disabled-by-default Podcast benefit bridge and Pool's
  independently reversible release identity.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-08-05

Release preparation:

- Added the pinned `aindaco1/dust-wave-platform` submodule as the versioned boundary for primitives shared with Store, Dust Wave, and Podcast.
- Moved the byte-identical Turnstile implementation into `@dustwave/worker-core` while retaining Pool's local import seam and adding a consumer contract test.
- Advanced the shared boundary to `@dustwave/worker-core` 0.2.0, which adds
  typed product-neutral crypto and Stripe mechanics for Podcast without moving
  Pool business rules or changing Pool's existing Turnstile adapter.
- Kept Pool's campaign, pledge, configuration, session, storage, and deployment authority independent; the submodule contains no Pool data or secrets and can be rolled back by pointer.
- Advanced `@dustwave/worker-core` to 0.3.0 and added an inert, fail-closed
  Pool-to-Podcast grant/revoke client with a shared high-entropy one-time-code
  contract. Product/tier mapping, durable delivery, and supporter issuance
  remain disabled until their explicit configuration and staging gate.
- Advanced the shared workspace to 0.6.0 and
  `@dustwave/admin-shell` 0.2.0, moving Pool and Store's byte-identical QR
  generator into the pinned shared boundary. Pool still loads the same
  characterized implementation through its static admin shell; only the
  source authority and generated path changed.
- Advanced the pinned shared workspace to 0.8.1 and
  `@dustwave/admin-shell` 0.7.1. The additive rich-editor `setHtml` API routes
  restored HTML through the existing allowlist sanitizer; Pool behavior is
  unchanged until a form opts into it, and rollback remains a one-commit
  submodule-pointer change.
- Advanced `@dustwave/admin-shell` to 0.8.0 and replaced Pool's inline browser
  exit listener with the shared fail-closed unsaved-change lifecycle guard.
  Pool retains its characterized content, settings, and administrator dirty
  baselines; Store remains unchanged until its separate editor baselines have a
  safe aggregate adapter.
- Advanced `@dustwave/admin-shell` to 0.8.1 and routed Pool's characterized
  dirty-action class, state attribute, localized label, and clean-state
  disabling through the shared primitive. Pool retains every editor baseline,
  force-disabled rule, and focus-ring style.
- Centralized the Worker provider identity and added a release-contract test
  that keeps root/Worker packages and locks, canonical config, release label,
  Stripe, and Resend aligned to v1.2.0.

## v1.1.2 - 2026-07-14

Release scope:

- Fixed misleading sitemap freshness by emitting `lastmod` only from real page/campaign dates, and expanded the generated audit to reject malformed XML, duplicates, invalid/future timestamps, private URLs, and structured-data drift.
- Added a dependency-free post-deploy crawl audit that compares ordinary and Google Inspection sitemap responses, validates sitemap/robots status and MIME types, and fetches every submitted public URL with bounded propagation retries.
- Added fail-closed, localized Shopping product pages that reuse a campaign's featured physical tier, existing cart behavior, configured author/company identity, and policy data. Product publishing requires an explicit enable switch plus complete physical-reward facts and an exact expected availability date.
- Kept the Their Love featured poster candidate disabled; confirming its exact availability date and completing Merchant Center verification plus feed/destination setup remain explicit Future Features before Shopping-tab placement is expected.
- Added Organization merchant return-policy/contact data, focused Product/Offer metadata, and direct links to stable Shipping and Return Policy anchors beside the DUST WAVE footer mark on desktop/tablet and below Terms in the mobile menu; automated checks ensure that a no-returns policy never publishes a fictitious return window.
- Rewrote the public About and Terms pages in English and neutral US/Latin American Spanish, using `_config.yml` identity/contact values and documenting all-or-nothing charging, shipping, final-sale defaults, fulfillment-error handling, seven-day reporting verification, privacy, and creative-submission rules.
- Reviewed Store v1.0.8 carryover: Pool already contained the relevant price, media, Stripe, reconciliation, and durable-email work; adopted the GitHub-hosted AWS CLI recovery fix; exposed the existing session review/revocation and audit search/CSV APIs through localized Settings sections; made their shared info-button guidance, filters, tables, revoke controls, plain-language actions, normalized targets (including generated local test slugs), and status/change explanations responsive and understandable from desktop through mobile while retaining canonical identifiers for filtering, diagnostics, and export; aligned shared Settings sections to Store's order while retaining Pool-specific seams; adapted Brand & SEO to the no-returns Shopping policy; and excluded Store-specific readiness, cache, catalog, order, coupon, ticket, download, R2, and multi-processor surfaces.
- Matched Store's local admin sign-in affordance by rendering the development-only returned login URL as a localized **Open admin** link while keeping deployed sign-in links email-only.
- Hardened the pre-merge Jekyll helpers so a failed host or Podman build cannot fall through to minification and validate stale `_site` output; the release gate now proves a fresh generated build before artifact checks.

Post-release cleanup:

- Removed the remaining implicit Jekyll collection-date fallback from sitemap, Open Graph article, JSON-LD, and generated Shopping-product metadata so deployments cannot impersonate content publication or modification dates. Sitemap `lastmod` now requires an authored `last_modified_at`; campaign article dates use explicit `published_at` when provided and otherwise the campaign start date.
- Added `/sitemap.txt` as a generated diagnostic sitemap using the exact same shared public-item selector as `/sitemap.xml`, without advertising a second canonical sitemap in `robots.txt`. Generated and post-deploy audits require its URL list to match the XML sitemap exactly and compare ordinary versus Google Inspection responses for both formats.
- Recorded post-deployment evidence that Search Console's official Inspection Tool reached the production sitemap from Google-owned addresses without Cloudflare mitigation while receiving a valid HTTP 200 XML response, isolating the remaining generic live-test error from the site's firewall and origin behavior.

## v1.1.1 - 2026-07-12

Release scope:

- Added a deterministic, rebuildable repository media manifest covering campaign/shared images, video, and audio; source hashes, dimensions, duration, file size, responsive WebP/WebM derivatives, reference locations, optimization state, and intentionally skipped larger derivatives stay reviewable in Git.
- Expanded the existing dashboard media picker with search, accessible type tabs, recent/name sorting, rich metadata, optimization and placement-budget warnings, reference visibility, broken-reference reporting, local video/poster/audio selection, and role-scoped repair actions through the existing optimizer workflow.
- Added safe same-campaign source replacement with GitHub SHA conflict protection, kept generated derivatives out of standalone picker results, and retained the repository as the only media authority—no KV media database or alternate storage backend was introduced.
- Added explicit decorative-image authoring while requiring alt text for meaningful images; legacy empty-alt content remains compatible with a migration warning.
- Hardened Stripe integration with an explicit API version, normalized redacted errors/observability, deterministic idempotency on retry-safe writes, explicit USD/timing metadata, 35-day webhook markers with processing leases, and a 400-day minimal processor-event journal.
- Made settlement crash/resume-safe with durable pre-charge group state, safe reuse within Stripe's idempotency window, stale-job checkpoints, successful PaymentIntent recovery, and needs-attention stops instead of blind recharges after ambiguous outcomes.
- Added scheduled and super-admin-triggered reconciliation of indexed pledge truth, Stripe PaymentIntents, and settlement jobs, recording open/resolved `reconciliation-break:v1:*` evidence without KV namespace scans.
- Routed production transactional, report, campaign update, Blast, launch-reminder, and abandoned-checkout email through a shared KV outbox with frozen payloads, deterministic Resend idempotency, bounded retries, crash leases, provider delivery webhooks, and privacy-minimized long-term delivery evidence; admin login and test sends remain immediate.
- Added signed campaign-scoped one-click unsubscribe for diary, milestone, and announcement email plus local permanent-bounce/complaint suppression compatible with Resend's email and webhook APIs.
- Added focused media, Stripe client, outbox, webhook-signature, retry, suppression, and existing Worker regression coverage; updated setup, Worker configuration, payment/email/security/workflow/dashboard/testing documentation, and roadmap status for the completed release.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-07-12

Release scope:

- Added optional variant-specific prices to platform and campaign add-ons. Blank prices inherit the product base price, explicit zero-dollar overrides remain valid, and cart/Manage Pledge cards update the displayed price when the selected variant changes.
- Kept money authority in the Worker: new or changed add-on variants are repriced from the current catalog, submitted browser prices are ignored, and an unchanged product/variant on an existing pledge preserves its valid historical `unitPrice` through quantity-only edits.
- Extended the shared add-on model, legacy browser fallbacks, admin product editor, validation, and YAML serialization without introducing a second catalog or migrating existing products. Product, variant, catalog, and historical prices cannot bypass the canonical `$1,000,000` amount ceiling.
- Replaced eager full-size campaign-card backgrounds with responsive WebP sources and lazy decoding, reducing the measured throttled homepage transfer from roughly 4.0 MB to 1.5 MB and LCP from roughly 20.3 seconds to 5.4–6.6 seconds.
- Added centralized, route-specific Lighthouse and expanded cache-policy release evidence alongside the existing generated-asset budgets. Eleven deployed public/private targets are covered, and Workers Cache remains disabled until representative evidence proves the configured p95 benefit.
- Made dashboard and Worker timing limits executable: browser tests consume readiness, tab-switch, and table-render budgets; the Worker samples dashboard summary/settings reads; and a redacted authenticated audit evaluates configured p95 ceilings without collecting request or customer payloads.
- Hardened admin failures so unauthorized responses are private and non-cacheable, and pinned the compatible clean Lighthouse release so both production-only and full dependency audits pass with no known vulnerabilities.
- Moved and refreshed `AGENTS.md` at the repository root so contributors and coding agents automatically discover the current checkout, security, performance, recovery, and release invariants.

## v1.0.9 - 2026-07-12

Release scope:

- Adapted backup and disaster-recovery model to Pool's Git, `PLEDGES`, `VOTES`, `RATELIMIT`, Stripe, and Durable Object boundaries, with an approved four-hour RPO/RTO and 7-daily/5-weekly/12-monthly plus release-snapshot retention policy.
- Added checksum-covered metadata and encrypted KV-value snapshots, repository-boundary checks, age/GPG encryption verification, release receipts, safe retention pruning, append-only off-device copies, and readiness evidence without secret-value export.
- Added classification-driven restore plans for local, preview, and production; authoritative-family validation; derived-state rebuilds; quarantine exclusions; exact preview cleanup; readback verification; and explicit production maintenance, Stripe, settlement, conflict, pre-restore-snapshot, and acknowledgement gates.
- Added synthetic weekly restore rehearsals and quarterly low-traffic protected preview drills with captured-production data disabled until protected credentials and operator approval are configured. Protected drills upload to S3-compatible off-account storage and verify a byte-identical download before restore.
- Added read-only Stripe reconciliation for snapshot pledge totals and PaymentIntent state, plus aggregate-only Cloudflare traffic preflight evidence.
- Split routine Pages refreshes from manual reviewed Worker/full production deployment, pinned all GitHub Actions to immutable commits, added monthly Dependabot coverage for Actions and both npm projects, and made Stripe CLI probes non-interactive.
- Added a shared Pool pledge read model with deterministic privacy-safe watermarks, no-change responses, and production KV bulk reads in batches of 100 across analytics, supporters, reports, index repair, settlement, and financial backfills.
- Added privacy-minimized admin login history, active/recent session review, explicit session revocation, searchable audit metadata, formula-safe audit CSV exports, and deferred Turnstile loading until unauthenticated state is known.
- Added a managed Cloudflare admin response-rule reconciler and public verification for `private, no-store, no-transform, max-age=0, must-revalidate` on English and Spanish admin routes.
- Split admin-only CSS from the public stylesheet, deferred Adobe display-font CSS, established measured generated-asset budgets, and kept Workers Cache disabled until representative evidence shows at least a 40% p95 benefit.
- Added weekly production-posture drift checks, monthly source-hashed Spanish review packets without claiming professional review, a scheduled Podman E2E workflow, and a 6 GiB Podman release-suite resource gate.
- Added sanitized JSON provider-evidence artifacts for downstream recovery/posture workflows, with failure/warning/skip counts and explicit credential/customer-data exclusions.

## v1.0.8 - 2026-07-01

Release scope:

- Ported Store-derived Cloudflare Rocket Loader hardening by opting Pool first-party layout/include scripts out with `data-cfasync="false"`, covering public campaign, cart, preview, manage, community, pledge-result, and admin surfaces.
- Hardened admin Marketing data loading so saved referral codes and abandoned-checkout health load lazily only when an authenticated admin opens Marketing, with campaign-scoped in-flight and loaded-state guards.
- Remembered the last admin dashboard tab plus Settings section, selected Campaigns campaign, and Campaigns subtab in browser-local state so reloads return admins to the same working context without Worker or KV writes.
- Added an explicit QR vendor browser-global shim so the admin Marketing QR builder does not rely on optimizer-sensitive classic-script globals.
- Added a locale completeness audit and unit coverage to keep supported i18n catalogs aligned with English.
- Added template regression coverage that scans layouts/includes for local first-party scripts missing the Rocket Loader opt-out.
- Moved Vitest config files to ESM `.mts` modules and updated scripts/Jekyll excludes to avoid Vite's deprecated CJS Node API path.
- Added a generated-site SEO audit (`npm run test:seo`) adapted from Store, wired it into the merge gate, and moved sitemap URL rendering into a shared include that emits localized hreflang alternates.
- Adapted release-evidence tooling for Pool with `release:smoke`, focused accessibility, rendered i18n/SEO, pledge/report evidence, provider readiness, payment smoke, and optional screen-reader transcript commands.
- Added a Release Provider Evidence GitHub Actions workflow for strict Cloudflare DNS evidence through a dedicated DNS-read token.
- Added Pool no-send email dry-run support through `POOL_EMAIL_DRY_RUN` / `RESEND_EMAIL_DRY_RUN` so release smokes can render supporter/report/admin email payloads without calling Resend.
- Added Pool-specific release accessibility evidence for campaign pledge focus order, launch-reminder live status updates, and reduced-motion campaign cart surfaces.
- Integrated release evidence command sanity into the merge gate and enabled Pool email dry-run mode for local/CI merge smoke runs.
- Added mobile metadata/CSS polish from Store so public, admin, manage, community, embed, preview, and pledge-result document heads opt out of automatic phone/date/address/email detection while shared controls inherit the current theme consistently.
- Updated the admin settings request to send the current preferred language, keeping Pool's existing client-side i18n row normalization ready for Worker-side schema localization.

## v1.0.7 - 2026-06-19

Release scope:

- Added campaign-scoped abandoned-checkout reminder health in Marketing with aggregate queue/outcome counts, recent outcomes, scoped suppression/clear controls, hashed email identifiers, audit events, signed checkout resume links, and no retry-specific abandoned-cart action.
- Hardened `npm run setup:deploy` with Cloudflare KV namespace reuse, clearer dry-run reuse/create output, live read-only provider readiness checks, `--skip-readiness` for narrow dry runs, and subprocess-based unit coverage for dry-run, local-secret, production-KV, readiness, and generated-secret paths.
- Added explicit shared Marketing and Blast drafts with one campaign-scoped KV record per surface, 7-day expiry, revision-conflict protection, and no background writes.
- Added Analytics referral/UTM performance reporting for saved and unsaved campaign links, including UTM source/medium/campaign/content aggregates from existing campaign pledge indexes without KV namespace scans.
- Added a shared WYSIWYG image media picker for Campaign Content, Diary, and Blast image blocks. Campaign users see campaign-scoped media; super admins can also select shared/default images. The picker is read-only and adds no new KV state.

## v1.0.6 - 2026-06-18

Release scope:

- Expanded **Campaigns -> Marketing** into a more complete campaign-promotion workspace without adding another top-level dashboard view. Campaign admins can build tracked URLs, save referral codes, preview/download campaign QR codes as PNG/SVG, and use the existing campaign embed builder from the same tab.
- Added **Campaigns -> Blast** for supporter email blasts. Assigned campaign users and super admins can draft with the shared WYSIWYG content editor, upload campaign-hosted images through the existing media pipeline, link YouTube/Vimeo videos in an email-safe way, send tests to themselves, send live blasts to indexed campaign supporters, and review read-only sent history.
- Added automatic Blast dry-run validation before test or live sends. Dry runs validate content and audience from the campaign pledge index without sending email, writing audit records, or listing KV namespaces; live sends require the matching dry-run hash and write the audit event after dispatch.
- Added browser-local QR generation adapted from the MIT-licensed `1612elphi/delphitools` approach, keeping QR previews and downloads free of Worker reads/writes.
- Added consent-based abandoned-checkout reminders for the first-party checkout path. Supporters must explicitly opt in, reminders queue only after Stripe session creation succeeds, completed pledges delete queued reminders, sent/suppressed audiences are deduped, and unsubscribe links are signed.
- Kept abandoned-checkout scheduling free-tier aware with `abandoned-cart-queue:v1`, bounded batches, retention limits, sent/suppression markers, and idle cron ticks that skip KV namespace list scans.
- Added the cross-platform `npm run setup:deploy` helper for local and production setup. The dependency-free Node CLI supports dry runs, local secret generation, config sync, Cloudflare KV creation/update, Worker secret writes, GitHub repository secret writes, `gh`/`wrangler`/optional Stripe CLI auth checks, and optional `wrangler deploy`.

## v1.0.5 - 2026-06-14

Release scope:

- Added protected campaign previews for super admins, assigned campaign users, and explicitly invited reviewer emails. Preview links are signed, campaign-scoped, dashboard-visible for the publishing admin, and expire after 24 hours.
- Added super-admin campaign creation for preview-only campaigns. Campaign users are optional at creation time; super admins can assign multiple existing users or create multiple new users, and assigned users receive the admin dashboard link by email when delivery is configured.
- Added super-admin campaign archiving for non-live campaigns. Local development archives through the mounted repo helper, while production dispatches the validated `archive-campaign` GitHub Actions workflow.
- Preserved public visibility and SEO boundaries: preview-only campaigns remain hidden from public campaign routes, home/community/add-on indexes, `/api/campaigns.json`, embeds, share-card metadata, sitemap output, robots intent, and public prefetching until launched.
- Preserved KV budget discipline: dashboard reads, preview rendering, field browsing, local drafts, reports, supporters, and analytics remain read-only; explicit create, preview publish, user save, archive audit, and email actions perform bounded writes.
- Added lightweight multi-user editing safeguards with GitHub base-revision checks for campaign content and preview publishes, stale-publish conflicts, local draft preservation, and audit events for create, preview publish, archive, and content publish actions.
- Kept the new dashboard UI accessible, localized, mobile-responsive, and DRY by reusing shared admin label/help/info-button, email-list, modal, focus, and status patterns.
- Improved Podman local development resilience with supervised service restarts, stale Podman recovery attempts, local repo helper support for create/archive testing, and updated Podman documentation.
- Added GitHub-backed protected preview publication at `/admin/campaign-preview/publish`, no-store preview payload reads at `/admin/campaign-preview/:slug`, generic noindex preview shells at `/campaigns/:slug/preview/` for every campaign slug so emailed links do not depend on a post-publish rebuild, and 24-hour KV preview access allowlists at `campaign-preview-reviewers:<slug>`.
- Added signed 24-hour dashboard preview links for the publishing admin, optional signed reviewer preview emails, and campaign-assignment emails through the shared Resend email theme and i18n catalog.
- Rendered protected preview payloads as full read-only campaign page previews with campaign CSS/fonts loaded, media embeds enabled, and pledge controls disabled.
- Matched protected-preview diary rendering to the public campaign diary tabs, phase panels, and dashed entry cards.
- Added super-admin dashboard controls for new preview-only campaign creation and protected preview publication.
- Added super-admin-only campaign archiving for non-live campaigns from Campaigns -> Settings, backed locally by dev-only repository writes and in production by a manual GitHub Actions workflow that moves `_campaigns/<slug>.md` and campaign-owned media into `archive/campaigns/<slug>/` without deleting archived data.
- Added preview-only/public filtering across campaign JSON, homepage/community/add-on indexes, localized pages, sitemap, robots intent, and prefetch eligibility.
- Added base-revision conflict checks for campaign content and preview publishes.
- Kept previewer emails out of GitHub-backed campaign Markdown and public generated artifacts; campaign source now carries only the preview flag and compatibility-empty `preview_reviewer_emails: []`.

## v1.0.4 - 2026-06-11

- Added super-admin Settings -> Plan usage tracking for Cloudflare Workers/KV and Resend quotas, with automatic load, provider-detected plan names where available, progress bars, warning thresholds, and provider plan links while keeping provider tokens server-side.
- Added dashboard net campaign/platform revenue analytics after allocated actual or estimated Stripe processor fees, while preserving gross Campaign revenue and Platform revenue cards for reconciliation.
- Added component-level processor fee allocation across campaign revenue, platform revenue, tax, and shipping so table/CSV exports reconcile with stored Stripe balance transactions or existing fee estimates.
- Documented usage-tracker environment variables and the read-only Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics plus Billing Read token boundary for usage and Workers plan detection.
- Reorganized local Worker `.dev.vars` scaffolding and `npm run secrets:dev` output into purpose-based groups, including Plan Usage provider settings and overrides.

## v1.0.3 - 2026-06-01

- Added configurable platform timezone handling across Jekyll campaign state, browser countdowns, Worker lifecycle automation, campaign-runner reports, dashboard settings, and Worker config mirroring. The default remains `America/Denver` for compatibility, and super admins can choose from supported IANA timezones.
- Added upcoming-campaign launch reminders with a slim public signup form, Cloudflare Turnstile verification, campaign/email dedupe, signed unsubscribe links, bounded KV dispatch jobs, and Resend delivery through the existing shared email module.
- Added Durable Object-backed campaign settlement serialization, deterministic Stripe idempotency keys, and mixed-campaign batch rejection so scheduled/manual settlement cannot overlap charges for the same campaign while multi-campaign carts remain campaign-scoped.
- Added scoped admin automation secrets for settlement and broadcast routes. When configured, `ADMIN_SETTLEMENT_SECRET` and `ADMIN_BROADCAST_SECRET` reject fallback use of the broader `ADMIN_SECRET`.
- Hardened production deployment credentials by requiring token-based Cloudflare auth, documenting the required Cloudflare user API token shape for Wrangler deploys, splitting cache purge onto `CLOUDFLARE_CACHE_PURGE_TOKEN`, and removing legacy or unused repo secrets.
- Hardened the deploy workflow so dashboard media optimization opens a pull request instead of pushing generated media changes directly to `main`.
- Tightened private CORS defaults, Stripe error redaction, checkout/settlement auth tests, and local secret generation for scoped admin secrets.
- Hardened public content and embed boundaries: campaign Markdown link sanitization now handles nested/encoded unsafe schemes, hosted embeds use specific postMessage target origins, and tokenized Manage pages opt into no-referrer behavior.
- Reduced baseline Workers KV write usage by changing the minute-level scheduler heartbeat to persist hourly instead of every minute, preserving cron health visibility while keeping the free-tier write budget available for real mutations.
- Reduced baseline Workers KV list usage by adding queue-state markers for launch reminder dispatch and supporter confirmation email retries, so idle scheduled ticks skip namespace scans and retry scans wait until the next queued attempt is due.
- Added a durable add-on inventory sold-count projection maintained by pledge create, modify, and cancel paths, avoiding repeated pledge namespace scans for normal add-on inventory reads after the first projection bootstrap.
- Updated local development so `_config.local.yml` can hide launch reminder Turnstile widgets the same way local admin sign-in can hide its Turnstile widget.
- Extended the Podman media optimizer image and wrappers with `optipng` and `gifsicle` so local PNG/GIF source compression uses the same repository media workflow as responsive image and video derivative generation.
- Added a mobile PageSpeed performance pass for campaign pages: YouTube hero videos now render as local poster/play facades and load the remote iframe only after play intent, avoiding the initial YouTube JavaScript/CSS cost.
- Added responsive hero-image preloads and a `640w` WebP derivative rung so mobile campaign pages can choose smaller browser assets between the existing `480w` and `960w` variants.
- Updated the media optimizer to skip generated responsive WebP derivatives during source optimization, keeping generated browser assets up to date without recursively re-encoding them.
- Fixed dashboard-authored diary rich text so inline bold/italic/underline markers normalize leading and trailing boundary spaces instead of rendering stray Markdown delimiters on public campaign pages.
- Fixed public diary hash links, including links into non-default diary tabs such as `#diary-production`, so the matching tab opens before the page scrolls to the anchor.
- Updated dashboard image/video uploads to dispatch the **Optimize dashboard media** workflow with `scope=changed` after the source-preserving GitHub commit succeeds; audio uploads remain source-preserved.
- Added publish-time cleanup for dashboard-owned campaign content and diary media that is removed from published content and no longer referenced elsewhere in the same campaign.

## v1.0.2 - 2026-06-01

- Added public-page performance fixes from the PageSpeed review: remote-video campaign pages no longer preload hidden fallback hero images, tier images opt into lazy/async decoding, default brand logos reserve their intrinsic dimensions, and public pages avoid eager Stripe preconnects before cart intent.
- Extended the dashboard media optimization pipeline to generate responsive WebP image variants for PNG, JPEG, and GIF source images, so public campaign templates can serve smaller browser assets while keeping original uploads as source-of-truth fallbacks.
- Added a manual `scope=all` option to the **Optimize dashboard media** workflow so existing campaigns can be reprocessed through the same media pipeline used for new dashboard uploads.
- Updated campaign, tier, card, gallery, and content-image templates to use generated responsive variants when they exist without changing visible page structure or campaign Markdown references.

## v1.0.1 - 2026-05-29

- Added actual Stripe balance transaction fee/net capture for newly charged pledges and a super-admin backfill path for older charged pledge records.
- Updated dashboard Analytics to prefer stored actual Stripe fees when available, keep estimated fees only where needed, and label mixed/estimated values clearly.
- Added admin content-editor media uploads for campaign and diary content blocks, with immediate local previews and publish-time upload into the correct campaign asset directories.
- Added the dashboard media optimization pipeline: `npm run media:optimize`, `npm run media:optimize:check`, and a GitHub Actions workflow that losslessly compresses uploaded images, generates high-quality WebM video derivatives, and rewrites literal campaign/config video references after derivatives exist.
- Kept dashboard uploads source-preserving in the Worker while documenting the external optimization step for operators and forks.
- Made Supporters and Analytics return empty read-only views for campaigns without pledge indexes instead of blocking new or empty campaign dashboards.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-05-26

- Added the private admin dashboard as the supported browser editing and operations surface at `/admin/` and `/es/admin/`.
- Added role-scoped magic-link admin authentication for super admins and campaign users, with cookie-backed sessions, CSRF/origin checks, and browser-safe admin APIs that do not expose `ADMIN_SECRET`.
- Added admin sign-in challenge protection support for Cloudflare Turnstile-compatible deployments while keeping local/test bypasses explicit.
- Added dashboard tabs for Settings, Add-ons, Campaigns, Analytics, Reports, Supporters, Marketing, Users, Secrets & credentials, and Runtime diagnostics.
- Replaced the Pages CMS editing model with the dashboard-driven workflow while keeping `_config.yml` and campaign Markdown as the reviewable fork-facing source of truth.
- Added WYSIWYG block editing for campaign content and diary entries, including media settings, link editing, Markdown-style inline formatting, mobile previews, local drafts, and publish-state tracking.
- Added dashboard editing for campaign settings, tiers, support items, campaign add-ons, stretch goals, ongoing items, diary entries, decisions, platform add-ons, and platform settings.
- Added dashboard upload handling for campaign media, brand assets, add-on images, and hero videos using convention-based asset directories and slug-style filenames.
- Added dashboard Users management backed by Worker KV at `admin-users:v1`, separate from GitHub-backed publish flows.
- Added notification emails for newly created dashboard users when Resend is configured; user edits do not resend invitations.
- Added dashboard Marketing tools for referral/UTM URL building, saved referral codes, reusable embed-builder UI, and copyable launch snippets.
- Fixed Marketing embed previews for campaigns with YouTube or Vimeo hero media so progress bars, milestones, and stretch-goal labels stay contained.
- Added role-scoped dashboard Analytics, Reports, and Supporters views with sortable/filterable tables, exact-cent dollar display, and CSV downloads; report previews/downloads do not send email or write sent markers.
- Preserved the Cloudflare Workers KV free-tier target by keeping normal dashboard reads, previews, filters, analytics, and local drafts at zero KV writes.
- Aligned pledge email sender configuration with the authorized Resend sender domain and documented sender-domain setup for forks.
- Made GitHub Pages deploy permissions explicit for the production deploy workflow.

## v0.9.5 - 2026-05-03

- Aligned local Worker development with GitHub Actions by moving the Podman Worker image to Node 24.
- Updated Worker `compatibility_date` to `2026-05-03` so Wrangler 4 / Miniflare starts cleanly under Node 24.
- Updated host and Podman test wrappers to prefer Node 24, with Node 22 as the minimum Wrangler 4 fallback.
- Switched the Podman Worker dependency bootstrap to `npm ci` so local container starts do not rewrite `worker/package-lock.json`.
- Expanded creator launch documentation with add-ons, hosted embeds, tax/shipping fallback expectations, free-shipping decisions, report recipients, and fulfillment handoff.
- Added a Spanish creator checklist route for fork and creator onboarding.

## v0.9.4 - 2026-05-02

- Previous milestone for campaign-runner reports, deployment hardening, creator checklist work, and Worker deployment compatibility updates.
