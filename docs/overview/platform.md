# The Pool

**Dust Wave's open-source crowdfunding platform** — [site.example.com](https://site.example.com)

Current release milestone: **v0.9.4**. The Pool will treat **v1.0** as the wider public launch milestone once the remaining roadmap items are complete.

A static Jekyll + first-party cart site for all-or-nothing creative crowdfunding. Backers build a pledge in The Pool’s browser-owned cart, the Cloudflare Worker canonicalizes the contribution via `/checkout-intent/start`, and Stripe collects and saves card details through a secure on-site payment step so cards are only charged after a successful campaign reaches its deadline. A single checkout can include items from multiple campaigns; after webhook confirmation, the Worker fans that bundle out into separate campaign-scoped pledge records. If funded, a Worker cron dispatches batched settlement and charges pledges off-session. Supporters can optionally add a platform tip, manage pledges through order-scoped magic links, and revisit a desktop-friendly Manage Pledge dashboard with Active / Closed sections.

## Features

- **No accounts required** — Backers manage pledges via email magic links
- **Server-verified checkout** — The Worker canonicalizes cart contents from first-party cart items instead of trusting browser-submitted totals
- **Multi-campaign checkout** — One checkout can include multiple campaigns, while storage, emails, reports, and management stay campaign-scoped after confirmation
- **All-or-nothing pledging** — Cards saved now, charged only if goal is met
- **Optional platform tip** — 0% to 15% tip (default 5%) included in totals but excluded from campaign progress
- **Tip-aware cart + checkout** — Shared pricing logic keeps subtotal, tip, tax, shipping, and total in sync across cart, checkout, Worker, reports, and emails
- **USPS-backed shipping quotes with fallback guardrails** — Physical checkout and modify flows can quote USPS domestic/international shipping, use explicit flat/manual rates where configured, fall back safely to configured flat rates, and support optional domestic signature upgrades without pushing quote churn into KV
- **Platform add-ons with inventory awareness** — Bundle-level merch add-ons can be attached to a checkout, stay editable in Manage Pledge, support per-variant stock, and ride the same canonical shipping/reporting/email flow without counting toward campaign funding goals
- **Campaign add-ons with campaign-aware accounting** — Campaign markdown can also define campaign-scoped add-ons that render in the same cart / Manage UI, count toward that campaign’s funding subtotal, follow campaign shipping overrides, and disappear automatically when the owning campaign pledge leaves the cart
- **On-site Stripe payment step** — The existing second checkout sidecar hosts secure Stripe payment UI, and Manage Pledge uses the same pattern for `Update Card`
- **Configurable pricing and tax-provider settings** — `pricing.*` and `tax.*` live in `_config.yml`, and the mirrored Worker vars are auto-synced into `worker/wrangler.toml` so browser previews, provisional tax states, and server-side totals stay aligned
- **Physical & digital tiers** — Physical items trigger shipping address capture during checkout plus Worker-calculated USPS quotes, configured fallback rates, and optional domestic signature upgrades when enabled
- **Order-scoped magic links** — Each supporter link only manages its own pledge/order
- **Safer supporter sessions** — Community pages keep supporter access in browser session storage instead of a long-lived token cookie
- **Stretch goals** — Auto-unlock at funding thresholds
- **Campaign lifecycle** — `upcoming` → `live` → `post` states with automatic transitions + Cloudflare cache purge
- **Countdown timers** — Mountain Time (MST/MDT) with automatic DST detection, pre-rendered to avoid flash
- **Production phases & registry** — Tabbed interface for itemized funding needs
- **Community decisions** — Voting/polling for backer engagement with published option allowlists and closed-decision lockout
- **Sanitized campaign content blocks** — Long-form campaign and diary content accepts Markdown plus a tiny safe inline subset (`<br>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<b>`, `<u>`), neutralizes unsafe Markdown link schemes, automatically opens external links in a new tab, and escapes or rejects other raw HTML
- **Strict structured embeds** — Approved `spotify`, `youtube`, and `vimeo` embeds are validated against exact trusted origins and embed paths instead of substring matching
- **Serialized limited-tier inventory** — Scarce rewards reserve through a per-campaign Durable Object at checkout start and confirm through that same coordinator at persistence time, so limited tiers do not oversell under concurrent demand
- **Strict missing-pledge handling** — Magic-link pledge reads fail closed with `404` when the backing pledge record is missing
- **Production diary** — Rich content updates with auto-broadcast emails to supporters
- **Announcements** — Admin broadcast emails with custom CTA links to supporters
- **Instagram integration** — Optional social CTA in supporter emails
- **Ongoing funding** — Post-campaign support section
- **Manage Pledge dashboard** — Desktop-friendly Active / Closed sections with locked-state read-only controls after deadline
- **Tip-aware emails + reports** — Supporter emails, pledge reports, and fulfillment exports all include the platform tip when present
- **Campaign-runner reports** — Configurable campaign-scoped daily pledge-ledger emails and post-deadline fulfillment exports can go to each campaign’s configured runner recipients, while platform-fulfilled rows can route separately to `support_email`, with concise deliverability-first subjects, campaign-specific guidance notes, and a dry-run/manual-send admin path for operations
- **Projection drift diagnostics** — Read-only admin checks and a local CLI can compare stored stats, inventory, and campaign indexes against saved pledge truth before any repair path mutates data
- **Shared visual system** — Public pages, campaign surfaces, cart / checkout, and Manage Pledge all use the same calmer reusable typography, button, field, and card language
- **Responsive mobile polish** — Campaign pages, checkout/manage flows, community pages, and long-form content have shared small-screen spacing, safe-area-aware drawers, larger tap targets, and overflow fixes instead of a separate mobile-only UI
- **Accessibility baseline** — Public shells now keep skip links and stable main landmarks, while cart / checkout flows use stronger dialog semantics, live-region updates, and clearer accessible labels without moving payment fields out of Stripe-owned secure UI
- **Variable-first fork customization** — structured config now drives branding, pricing, Worker-synced settings, core brand assets, curated design variables, themed Stripe Elements, and branded supporter emails without requiring custom code for normal fork rebranding
- **Hosted live campaign embeds** — Campaign pages now link to a locale-aware embed builder that generates copy-paste iframe code with layout/theme/media/CTA options, live Worker-backed data, and auto-resize behavior
- **English + Spanish i18n foundation** — `_config.yml` now drives supported languages, static locale routes, generated localized campaign routes, shared translation data, and a quieter footer language switcher, with Spanish live across home/about/terms, public campaign pages, embed pages, pledge-result pages, `/manage/`, `/community/`, supporter community routes, site-owned cart/community/Manage Pledge/embed runtime copy, campaign countdown/gallery/live-stats labels, cart-button summaries, checkout tax-location helper copy, hero video/community teaser/diary chrome, localized campaign dates, and localized Worker supporter emails
- **SEO fundamentals baseline** — Public pages and campaign pages now emit consistent titles, descriptions, canonicals, OG/Twitter tags, localized language metadata, honest JSON-LD, Worker-generated campaign share-card images, and alternate-language metadata where supported, while `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and explicit noindex rules keep private/tokenized flows out of search intent
- **CMS Integration** — [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org) for visual campaign editing

## Architecture

```
[Visitor] → GitHub Pages (Jekyll + first-party cart / checkout sidecars)
          → Cloudflare Worker (on-site Stripe session bootstrap + webhook + cron)
```

| Layer | Platform | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| Frontend | GitHub Pages | Jekyll + Sass + first-party cart runtime |
| Payments | Stripe | Secure payment fields, saved payment methods, off-session charges |
| API | Cloudflare Worker | Checkout-session bootstrap, webhook, tip-aware totals, stats, auto-settle, cache purge |
| CMS | Pages CMS | Visual campaign editing (commits to GitHub) |

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run podman:doctor
./scripts/dev.sh --podman
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

That is the recommended local development path. It boots Jekyll, the Worker, optional Stripe CLI forwarding, and the local support services together with the repo's current defaults.

If you want to rebuild the Podman dev images after dependency or base-image changes:
```bash
PODMAN_REBUILD=1 ./scripts/dev.sh --podman
```

Fork-friendly pricing settings live in:
- `pricing.sales_tax_rate`, `pricing.default_tip_percent`, and `pricing.max_tip_percent` in [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml)
- auto-synced Worker vars `SALES_TAX_RATE`, `DEFAULT_PLATFORM_TIP_PERCENT`, and `MAX_PLATFORM_TIP_PERCENT` in [`worker/wrangler.toml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/wrangler.toml)

Fork-friendly tax-engine settings live in:
- `tax.provider`, `tax.origin_country`, `tax.use_regional_origin`, `tax.nm_grt_api_base`, and `tax.zip_tax_api_base` in [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml)
- mirrored Worker vars `TAX_PROVIDER`, `TAX_ORIGIN_COUNTRY`, `TAX_USE_REGIONAL_ORIGIN`, `NM_GRT_API_BASE`, and `ZIP_TAX_API_BASE` in [`worker/wrangler.toml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/wrangler.toml)
- `tax.provider: flat` keeps the legacy configured-rate baseline from `pricing.sales_tax_rate`
- `tax.provider: offline_rules` uses vendored international VAT/GST rules plus state-level fallback behavior
- `tax.provider: nm_grt` uses the vendored New Mexico starter dataset first and can refine New Mexico street-address lookups against the free EDAC GRT API
- optional Worker secret `ZIP_TAX_API_KEY` when `tax.provider: zip_tax` is enabled for local/jurisdiction-level US tax lookups

Current checkout behavior is intentionally conservative: if the browser does not yet have enough destination data, the cart shows provisional tax as `--` and the final tax quote is resolved once the Worker has enough billing or shipping location detail.

Fork-friendly shipping settings live in:
- `shipping.origin_*`, `shipping.fallback_flat_rate`, `shipping.free_shipping_default`, and `shipping.usps.*` in [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml)
- auto-synced Worker vars like `SHIPPING_ORIGIN_ZIP`, `SHIPPING_FALLBACK_FLAT_RATE`, `USPS_ENABLED`, `USPS_CLIENT_ID`, and the USPS timeout/cache/cooldown knobs in [`worker/wrangler.toml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/wrangler.toml)

Keep `USPS_CLIENT_SECRET` out of site config. Set it as a Worker secret or in [`worker/.dev.vars`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/.dev.vars) for local development.

If you change those values locally, restart `./scripts/dev.sh --podman` so the Worker uses the same math as the site.

Fork-friendly global merch/add-on settings now also live in:
- `add_ons.enabled`, `add_ons.low_stock_threshold`, and `add_ons.products` in [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml)
- product images, size-aware variants, per-product or per-variant inventory, and `shipping_preset` references for physical catalog items
- bundle-level add-ons can now be selected in the cart sidecar, anchored to a campaign in multi-campaign carts, and edited later from Manage Pledge
- low-stock messaging and sold-out variant filtering now come from the shared inventory-aware add-on product-state layer used by both cart and Manage Pledge
- configured add-on inventory is the starting baseline; remaining stock is derived from saved pledge state, not unsaved cart or Manage drafts
- pledge and fulfillment reports now separate campaign pledge value from platform add-on value for easier operations

Fork-facing settings now use a structured config model in [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.yml):

- `platform` for identity, URLs, and support contact
- `platform` also covers brand assets like logo, footer logo, favicon, and default social image
- top-level `title` / `description` for Jekyll's site identity and default SEO copy
- `seo` for bounded SEO identity knobs like `x_handle`, `same_as`, `default_social_image_alt`, `og_locale_overrides`, and whether the public community hub should remain indexable
- `pricing` for the flat-rate compatibility baseline and platform-tip defaults
- `tax` for choosing the Worker tax engine and its non-secret lookup settings
- `shipping` for origin settings, USPS quote behavior, fallback policy, free-shipping defaults, shipping presets, and limited shipping-option policy
- `add_ons` for a small global merch catalog, fixed-price products, and simple variants like shirt sizes
- `reports` for campaign-runner report timing, attachments, summaries, subject-prefix behavior, and the split fulfillment-email workflow alongside `platform.support_email`
- campaign front matter `campaign_add_ons` for campaign-scoped merch that should use the same card UI but count toward that campaign’s subtotal and shipping rules
- `i18n` for default/supported languages, language labels, and localized public-page routes
- `design` for curated typography, radius, layout-width, and theme-token overrides
- a small curated subset of `platform` / `design` is mirrored into the Worker so supporter emails stay aligned with fork branding too
- `debug` for browser and Worker console logging behavior
- `checkout` for truly variable checkout settings like the Stripe publishable key
- `cache` for live browser TTLs

[`_config.local.yml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/_config.local.yml) is now intentionally thin: it should only carry true local overrides like localhost URLs and `show_test_campaigns`, not a second copy of the base config.

See [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](/docs/development/customization-guide/) for the supported no-code customization surface and which settings are automatically mirrored to the Worker.
See [docs/SEO.md](/docs/operations/seo/) for the current SEO fundamentals implementation and supported SEO surface.
See [docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md](/docs/operations/accessibility/) for the current accessibility baseline and verified critical flows.
See [docs/I18N.md](/docs/development/internationalization/) for the locale model, shared translation sources, and localized route behavior.

For localization, the supported model is:

- shared UI/runtime/email copy lives in `_data/i18n/{lang}.yml`
- localized long-form pages still need localized source files under the locale prefix
- generated campaign pages and embed pages now participate in the locale model too, so `/campaigns/{slug}/` can switch cleanly to `/es/campaigns/{slug}/`
- the shared footer language switcher preserves the current query string and hash, so tokenized routes like `/manage/?t=...` can switch to `/es/manage/?t=...` without dropping pledge access

The main local/dev/test paths already sync those mirrored Worker values automatically. If you want to refresh the Worker config directly, run:

```bash
npm run sync:worker-config
```

If you specifically need the host-only fallback instead:
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.local.yml
```

For a full host-only stack, run the Worker separately with `cd worker && wrangler dev --env dev --port 8787`.

See [docs/PODMAN.md](/docs/operations/podman-local-dev/) for the current scope and limitations.

The Podman path is host-validated on macOS. Linux and Windows are supported by design and have doctor/self-check coverage, but were not host-validated in this thread.

The checkout and E2E helper scripts also support that mode:

```bash
./scripts/test-checkout.sh --podman
./scripts/test-e2e.sh --podman
./scripts/test-worker.sh --podman
./scripts/smoke-pledge-management.sh --podman
./scripts/pledge-report.sh --podman --local
./scripts/fulfillment-report.sh --podman --local
./scripts/check-projections.sh --podman
npm run test:e2e:headless:podman
npm run podman:doctor
npm run podman:self-check
```

If you want to exercise the on-site Stripe checkout locally, add `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_TEST=pk_test_...` to [`worker/.dev.vars`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/.dev.vars) before starting the stack.

## Cloudflare Plan Guidance For Forks

The Pool is intentionally shaped so most traffic stays cheap:

- GitHub Pages serves the static site, so normal page loads do not invoke the Worker
- public live data now prefers one combined `/live/:slug` request instead of separate stats + inventory calls
- campaign pages cache live stats and inventory in `localStorage` for `cache.live_stats_ttl_seconds` / `cache.live_inventory_ttl_seconds` (default `300`)
- background tabs stop refreshing until the page becomes visible again
- single-campaign reports, stats rebuilds, settlement helpers, and admin supporter enumeration prefer `campaign-pledges:{slug}` indexes before falling back to expensive namespace scans, and stats/inventory rebuilds now repair stale campaign indexes when they detect drift
- the new read-only drift checks make it easier to confirm when projections are stale before running a repair path
- limited-tier write paths now ask the coordinator for reservation-aware availability instead of rebuilding truth from KV reservation keys
- public read paths stay intentionally permissive so a legitimately popular campaign does not hit artificial anti-DoS ceilings, while the expensive checkout / Manage / admin writes carry the tighter rate limits and request-size caps
- once a client is already over a rate limit window, repeated blocked requests no longer rewrite the same KV counter on every hit
- `POST /checkout-intent/abandon` uses an order-scoped retry bucket so unload/retry cleanup stays friendly to shared IPs without leaving the release path wide open
- the Worker config also sets `limits.cpu_ms = 100` for deployed Standard/Paid Workers, which is well above the current representative unit-harness timings (`6-28 ms`) while still dramatically below Cloudflare's default 30-second ceiling for paid deployments

Fork knobs worth knowing:

- site config: `cache.live_stats_ttl_seconds`, `cache.live_inventory_ttl_seconds`, `pricing.sales_tax_rate`, `pricing.flat_shipping_rate`, `tax.*`
- Worker env: auto-synced pricing and tax-provider values in [`worker/wrangler.toml`](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/blob/main/worker/wrangler.toml)

### Practical Scalability Scenarios

These are rough planning scenarios, not guarantees. They assume the default 5-minute browser cache TTLs, mostly normal user behavior, and Cloudflare’s current published Workers and KV pricing/limits.

| Scenario | Rough daily activity | Plan outlook |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Small collective launch | ~1,500 campaign-page visits, ~75 manage/supporter visits, ~20 checkout starts, ~10 completed pledges | Free should still be viable. This is the operating shape The Pool is designed to handle cheaply. |
| Busy launch week | ~8,000 campaign-page visits, ~250 manage/supporter visits, ~60 checkout starts, ~25 completed or modified pledges | Often still plausible on Free if abuse stays low and admin repair flows are rare, but this is where Paid starts buying real margin. |
| Growing multi-project studio | ~20,000+ dynamic reads per day or many dozens of completed / modified / cancelled pledges per day | Start planning for Paid before a major push. Mutation-heavy days and abuse-path overhead become the part to watch first. |

As of April 18, 2026, Cloudflare documents the Workers Free plan at `100,000` requests per day. The Workers Paid plan starts at `$5/month` and includes `10 million` requests per month plus `30 million` CPU ms per month before overage pricing. Workers KV Free includes `100,000` reads/day plus only `1,000` writes/day and `1,000` list requests/day, while Workers KV on the Paid plan includes `10 million` reads/month and `1 million` writes/month before overages:

- [Cloudflare Workers pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/)
- [Cloudflare Workers KV pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/platform/pricing/)
- [Cloudflare Workers KV limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/platform/limits/)

The practical takeaway for forks is simple: The Pool can still fit the Workers Free plan for its intended “small number of concurrent campaigns, modest backer volume, one-month run” shape, especially because public read traffic is cheap and most days have little mutation traffic. The reason to move to Paid is not that Free suddenly stopped working, but that Paid gives healthier headroom for flash spikes, abuse-path KV writes, heavier modify/cancel activity, and more operator tooling.

One deployment nuance: Cloudflare's configurable `limits` block is only enforced on the Standard Usage Model and only on deployed Workers, not in local development. That means the new `cpu_ms` guard is a denial-of-wallet backstop for Paid deployments, while Workers Free still relies on Cloudflare's built-in free-plan ceilings.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test:premerge  # Syntax + full/focused regressions + first-party build checks + local smoke + security + headless E2E
npm run test:secrets   # Secret exposure audit against local env files, tracked files, and git history
npm run test:unit      # Unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test:e2e       # E2E tests (Playwright) — fully automated browser coverage
npm run test:e2e:headless # CI-style automated browser suite
npm run test:e2e:headless:podman -- tests/e2e/accessibility-public-pages.spec.ts --project=chromium # Podman-backed public accessibility slice
npm run test:security  # Security tests — pen testing the Worker API
npm run test:security:podman # Security tests with a Podman-backed local stack in one invocation
npm test               # Run unit + e2e
```

Local reporting:
```bash
./scripts/pledge-report.sh --local
./scripts/fulfillment-report.sh --local
./scripts/check-projections.sh
ADMIN_SECRET=... ./scripts/check-observability.sh --local
```

Podman-backed local testing:

```bash
./scripts/test-checkout.sh --podman  # Manual interactive checkout helper against the Podman dev stack
./scripts/test-e2e.sh --podman       # Automated browser helper against the Podman dev stack
./scripts/test-worker.sh --podman    # Site/Worker contract smoke against the Podman dev stack
./scripts/smoke-pledge-management.sh --podman  # Mutable-pledge smoke against the Podman dev stack
./scripts/pledge-report.sh --podman --local    # Local ledger CSV through the Worker container
./scripts/fulfillment-report.sh --podman --local # Local fulfillment CSV through the Worker container
npm run test:e2e:headless:podman     # Automated browser suite with Playwright in a container
npm run test:security:podman         # Security suite against a one-shot Podman-backed local stack
```

The pre-merge gate now tries the host Bundler/Jekyll path first, including a one-time `bundle install` attempt when Bundler is present but gems are missing. It keeps the lighter host Worker smoke, but runs the mutable-pledge smoke through the Podman-backed stack so the stateful modify/cancel path uses isolated local service state even when the host build path succeeds. That mutable smoke also rotates its synthetic admin request IPs so the Worker's real admin rate limit does not create false failures during local projection rebuild checks. If the host Ruby path still cannot produce a clean build, the gate now falls back to the Podman-backed artifact build instead of failing early on host setup.

The headless browser harness now builds a clean static `_site` and serves it with a lightweight HTTP server rather than relying on `jekyll serve`, which keeps browser regressions closer to the actual published asset shape.

- `pledge-report.sh` is a ledger/history export, so modified pledges appear as deltas and mixed changes now keep tip-update context in the `items` column.
- `fulfillment-report.sh` is the merged current-state view per `email + campaign`, which is the better comparison point for repeat backers and non-stackable projects.
- `check-projections.sh` is the read-only operator check for stored `campaign-pledges:{slug}`, `stats:{slug}`, and `tier-inventory:{slug}` drift before you decide to repair anything.
- if the site ever drifts from the current-state fulfillment view, the admin stats/inventory recalc paths now self-heal stale `campaign-pledges:{slug}` indexes instead of trusting them forever.

**Current full-suite baseline:**
- Pre-merge gate: passes locally and in the PR `Merge Smoke` workflow
- Unit, security, and headless E2E suites are green on this branch

**Test coverage includes:** live-stats functions, platform tip helpers, first-party checkout intent hashing and payload wiring, supporter email tip breakdowns, pledge-management flags, settlement totals, progress bars, tier unlocks, support items, countdown timers, cart flow, accessibility (including axe-backed public-page checks across campaign, community, and pledge-result states, ARIA snapshots, and keyboard-only checkout/manage/community/public-control assertions), mobile viewport regressions for public pages and pledge flows, campaign states, secret exposure auditing, campaign-content HTML/link/embed auditing, serialized tier-inventory coordination, and hardening around `/checkout-intent/start`, webhook handling, magic-link scope, settlement integrity, and paginated rebuild/backfill paths.

For local merge smoke on mutable pledges, use:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-pledge-management.sh
```

For the lighter site/Worker contract smoke, including removed-endpoint checks and malformed `/checkout-intent/start` coverage, use:

```bash
./scripts/test-worker.sh
```

## Deployment

Push `main` to deploy production:
```bash
git push origin main
```

That GitHub Actions workflow now deploys both:
- the GitHub Pages site
- the Cloudflare Worker from `worker/wrangler.toml`

Required GitHub repository secrets for automatic Worker deployment:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `ADMIN_SECRET` for the post-deploy diary check

Temporary fallback: the workflow also supports legacy Cloudflare auth via
- `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`
- `CLOUDFLARE_KEY`

The token + account ID path is still the recommended long-term setup.

Manual Worker fallback from the repo root:
```bash
npm run deploy:worker
```

The Worker powers:
- on-site Stripe setup-mode session bootstrap for the first-party checkout sidecar and the Manage Pledge `Update Card` modal, with hosted fallback still available as a compatibility path
- webhook processing and pledge persistence
- tip-aware total calculation
- supporter email delivery via Resend
- batched settlement and retry flows
- admin recovery and reporting endpoints
